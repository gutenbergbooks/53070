<p>Tharald and his brother Anders were bathing one day
in the lake. The water was deliciously warm, and the
two boys lay quietly floating on their backs, paddling
gently with their hands. All of a sudden Tharald gave
a scream. A big trout leaped into the air, and almost in
the same instant a black, shiny head rose out of the
water right between his knees. The trout, in its descent,
gave him a slap of its slimy tail across his face.
The black head stared out at him, for a moment, with
an air of surprise, then dived noiselessly into the deep.</p>

<p>Anders hurried to shore as rapidly as arms and legs
would propel him.</p>

<p>“It was the sea-serpent,” said he.</p>

<p>He was so frightened that he grew almost numb; his
breath stuck in his throat, and the blood throbbed in his
ears.</p>

<p>“Oh, you sillibub!” shouted his brother after him, “it
was an otter chasing a salmon-trout. The trout will
always leap, when chased.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when, but a few rods from
Anders, appeared the black, shiny head again, this time
with the trout in its mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>“He has his lair somewhere around here,” said Tharald;
“let us watch him, and see where he is going.”</p>

<p>The otter was nearing the shore. He swam rapidly,
with a slightly undulating motion of the body, so that,
at a distance, he might well have been mistaken for a
large water-snake. When he had reached the shore, he
dragged the fish up on the sand, spied cautiously about
him, to see if he was watched, and again seizing the trout,
slid into the underbrush. There was something so delightfully
wild and wary about it that the boys felt the
hunter’s passion aroused in them, and they could scarcely
take the time to fling on their clothes before starting in
pursuit. Like Indians, they crept on hands and feet over
the mossy ground, bent aside the bushes, and peered
cautiously between the leaves.</p>

<p>“Sh&mdash;sh&mdash;sh! we are on the track,” whispered Tharald,
stooping to smell the moss. “He has been here
within a minute.”</p>

<p>“Here is a drop of fish-blood,” answered Anders, pointing
to a twig, over which the fish had evidently been
dragged.</p>

<p>“Serves him right, the rascal,” murmured his elder
brother.</p>

<p>“If we haven’t got him now, my name is not Anders,”
whispered the younger.</p>

<p>They had advanced about fifty rods from the water,
when their attention was arrested by two faint tracks
among the stones&mdash;so faint, indeed, that no eyes but
those of a hunter would have discovered them. A
strange pungent odor, as of something wild, pervaded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
air; the whirring of the crickets in the tree-tops seemed
hushed and timid, and little silent birds hopped about in
the elder-bushes as if afraid to make a noise.</p>

<p>The boys lay down flat on the ground, and following
the two tracks, discovered that they converged toward a
frowsy-looking juniper-bush which grew among the roots
of a big old pine. Very cautiously they bent the bush
aside.</p>

<p>What was that? There stood the old otter, tearing
away at his trout, and three of the prettiest little black
things your eyes ever fell upon were gambolling about
him, picking up bits of the fish, and slinging them about
in their efforts to swallow.</p>

<p>The boys gave a cry of delight. But the otter&mdash;what
do you think he did? He showed a set of very ugly
teeth, and spat like an angry cat. It was evidently not
advisable to molest him with bare hands.</p>

<p>In hot haste Tharald and Anders by their united
weight broke off a young elder-tree and stripped off the
leaves. Now they could venture a battle. Eagerly they
pulled aside the juniper. But alas, Mr. Otter was gone,
and had taken his family with him.</p>

<p>To track him through the tangled underbrush, where he
probably knew a hundred hiding-places, would be a hopeless
task. The boys were about to return, baffled and
disappointed, to the lake, when it occurred to Tharald to
explore the den.</p>

<p>There was a hole under the tree-root, just big enough
to put a fist through, and, without thought of harm, the
boy flung himself down and thrust his arm in to the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
elbow. He fumbled about for a moment&mdash;ah, what was
that?&mdash;something soft and hairy, that slipped through
his fingers. Tharald made a bold grab for it&mdash;then with
a yell of pain pulled out his hand. The soft thing followed,
but its teeth were not soft. As Tharald rose to
his feet, there hung a tiny otter with its teeth locked
through the fleshy part of his hand, at the base of the
thumb.</p>

<p>“Look here, now,” cried his brother; “sit down
quietly, and I will soon rid you of the little beast.”</p>

<p>Tharald, clinching his teeth, sat down on a bowlder.
Anders drew his knife.</p>

<p>“No, I thank you,” shouted Tharald, as he saw the
knife, “I can do that myself. I don’t want you to harm
him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to harm him,” said Anders. “I only
want to force his mouth open.”</p>

<p>To this Tharald submitted. The knife was carefully
inserted at the corner of the little monster’s mouth, when
lo! he let the hand go, and snapped after the knife-blade.
Anders quickly threw his hat over him, and held it down
with his knees, while he tore a piece off the lining of his
coat to bandage his brother’s wound. Then they trudged
home together with the otter imprisoned in the hat.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>You would scarcely have thought that “Mons”&mdash;for
that became <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: ‘the otto’s name’">the otter’s name</ins>&mdash;would have made a pleasant
companion; but strange as it may seem, he improved
much, as soon as he got into civilized society. He soon
learned that it was not good-manners to snarl and show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
his teeth when politely addressed, and if occasionally he
forgot himself, he got a little tap on the nose which quickened
his memory. He was scarcely six inches long when
he was caught, not reckoning the tail; and so sleek and
nimble and glossy, that it was a delight to handle him
His fur was of a very dark brown, and when it was wet
looked black. It was so dense that you could not, by
pulling the hair apart, get the slightest glimpse of the
skin. But the most remarkable things about Mons were
the webs he had between his toes, and his long glossy
whiskers. Of the latter he was particularly proud; he
would allow no one to touch them.</p>

<p>Tharald taught him a number of tricks, which Mons
learned with astonishing ease. He was so intelligent
that Sultan, the bull-terrier, grew quite jealous of him.</p>

<p>Inquisitiveness seemed to be the strongest trait in
Mons’s character. His curiosity amounted to an overmastering
passion. There was no crevice that he did not
feel called upon to investigate, no hole which he did not
suspect of hiding some interesting secret. Again and
again he made explorations in the flour-barrel, and came
out as white as a miller. Once, for the sake of variety,
he put his nose into the inkstand, and in attempting to
withdraw it, poured the contents over his head.</p>

<p>In the part of Norway where Tharald’s father lived,
the people added largely to their income by salmon-fishing.
Nay, those who had no land made their living
entirely by fishing and shooting. Every spring the salmon
migrated from the sea into the rivers, to deposit their
spawn; you could see their young darting in large schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
over the pebbles in the shallows of the streams, pursued
by the big fishes that preyed upon them. Then the
perch and the trout grew fat, and the pike and the pickerel
made royal meals out of the perch and trout. All
along the coast lay English schooners, ready to buy up
the salmon and carry it on ice to London. Everywhere
there was life and traffic; everybody felt prosperous and
in good-humor.</p>

<p>It was during this season that Tharald one day walked
down to the lake to try his luck with a fly. It had been
raining during the night; and the trees along the shore
shivered and shook down showers of raindrops. The
only trouble was that the water was so clear that you
could see the bottom, which sloped gently outward for
fifty or a hundred feet. Mons, who was now a year old,
was sitting in his usual place on Tharald’s shoulder, and
was gazing contentedly upon the smiling world which
surrounded him. He was so fond of his master, now,
that he followed him like a dog, and could not bear to
be long away from him.</p>

<p>“Mons,” said Tharald, after having vainly thrown the
alluring fly a dozen times into the river, “I think this is
a bad day for fishing; or what do you think?”</p>

<p>At that very instant a big salmon-trout&mdash;a six-pounder
at the very least&mdash;leaped for the fly, and with a splash
of its tail sent a shower of spray shoreward. The line
flew with a hum from the reel, and Tharald braced himself
to “play” the fish, until he should tire him sufficiently
to land him.</p>

<p>But the trout was evidently of a different mind. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sprang out of the water, and his beautiful spotted sides
gleamed in the sun.</p>

<p>That was a sight for Mons! Before his master could
prevent him, he plunged from his shoulder into the
lake, and shot through the clear tide like a black arrow.
The trout saw him coming, and made a desperate
leap!</p>

<p>The line snapped; the trout was free!</p>

<p>Free! It was delightful to see Mons’s supple body as
it glided through the water, bending upward, downward,
sideward, with amazing swiftness and ease. His two big
eyes (which were conveniently situated so near the tip
of his nose that he could see in every direction with
scarcely a turn of the head) peered watchfully through
the transparent tide, keeping ever in the wake of the
fleeing fish. If the latter had had the sense to keep
straight ahead, he might have made good his escape.
But he relied upon strategy, and in this he was no match
for Mons. He leaped out of the water, darted to the
right and to the left, and made all sorts of foolish and
flurried manœuvres. But with the calmness of a Von
Moltke, Mons outgeneralled him. He headed him off
whenever he turned, and finally by a brisk turn plunged
his teeth into the trout’s neck, and brought him to
land.</p>

<p>I need not tell you that Tharald made a hero of him.
He hugged him and patted him and called him pet
names, until Mons grew quite bashful. But this exploit
of Mons’s gave Tharald an idea. He determined to train
him as a salmon-fisher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>It was in the spring of 1880, when Mons was two
years old and fully grown, that he landed his first salmon.
And when he had landed the first, it cost him little trouble
to secure the second and the third. Tharald felt like
a rich man that day, as he carried home in his basket
three silvery beauties, worth, at the very least, a dollar and
a half apiece. He made haste to dispose of them to an
English yachtsman at that figure, and went home in a
radiant humor, dreaming of “gold and forests green,” as
the Norwegians say.</p>

<p>“Now, Mons,” he said to his friend, whom he was
leading after him by a chain, “if we do as well every day
as we have done to-day, we shall soon be rich enough to
go to school. What do you think of that, Mons?”</p>

<p>One day a big fish-tail splashed out of an eddy, and a
black furry head and back rose for an instant and were
whirled out of sight.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, dear,” cried Tharald, “he will die! He
will drown! How often have I told you, Mons,” he
shouted, “that you shouldn’t attack fishes that are bigger
than yourself.”</p>

<p>“Whom are you talking to?” asked a fisherman named
John Bamle, who had come to look after his traps.</p>

<p>“To Mons,” answered the boy, anxiously.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say your brother is out there in
the water!” shouted John Bamle, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mons, my otter,” cried Tharald, piteously.</p>

<p>“Mons, your brother!” yelled the man, and seizing a
boat-hook, he ran out on the beams from which the traps
were suspended. The roar of the waters was so loud that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
it was next to impossible to distinguish words, and “Mons,
my otter,” and “Mons, my brother,” sounded so much
alike that it was not wonderful that John mistook the
former for the latter. For awhile he balanced himself by
means of the boat-hook on the slippery beams, peering all
the while anxiously into the rapids.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw something struggling in the water;
showers of spray whirled upward. Could it be possible
that a fish had attacked the drowning child? Full of
pity, he stretched himself forward, extending the boat-hook
before him, when lo! he lost his balance, and tumbled
headlong into the cataract.</p>

<p>Half a dozen other fishermen who were sauntering
down the hill-sides saw their comrade fall, and rushed
into the water to rescue him.</p>

<p>One man, bolder than the rest, sat astride a floating log
and rode out into the seething current. Now he was
thrown off; now he scrambled up again; at last, as his
drowning comrade appeared for the third time, with an
arm extended out of a whirling eddy, he caught him
deftly with his boat-hook, and pulled him up toward the
log.</p>

<p>As John Bamle lay there, more dead than alive, upon
the bank, emitting streams of water through mouth and
nostrils, the question was asked how he came to endanger
his life in such a reckless manner. At that very
instant the head of a black otter was seen emerging
from the water, dragging a huge salmon up among the
stones.</p>

<p>“Look, the otter, the otter!” cried the men; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
shower of stones hailed down upon the bowlder upon
which Mons had sought refuge.</p>

<p>“Let him alone, I tell you!” screamed Tharald; “he
is mine.”</p>

<p>And with three leaps he was at Mons’s side, wringing
wet from top to toe, but happy to have his friend once
more in safety. He seized him in his arms, and would
have borne him ashore, if the enormous salmon had not
demanded all his strength.</p>

<p>As they again reached the bank, the fishermen gathered
about them; but Mons slunk cautiously at his master’s
heels. He understood the growling comments, as one
man after the other lifted the big salmon and estimated
its weight. John Bamle had now so far regained consciousness
that he could speak, and he stared with no
friendly eye at the boy who had come near causing his
death.</p>

<p>“Come, now, Mons,” said Tharald, “come, and let us
hurry home to breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Mons!” repeated John Bamle; “is <em>that</em> your
Mons?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is my Mons,” answered Tharald, innocently.</p>

<p>“Then you just wait till I am strong enough to stand
on my legs, and I’ll promise to give you a thrashing that
you’ll remember to your dying day,” said John, and
shook his big fist.</p>

<p>Tharald was not anxious to wait under such circumstances,
but betook himself homeward as rapidly as his
legs would carry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>During the next week Tharald did his best to avoid
the fishermen. And yet, try as he might, he could not
help meeting them on the road, or on the river-bank, as
he carried home his heavy load of salmon.</p>

<p>“Hallo! How is your brother Mons?” they jeered,
when they saw him.</p>

<p>Occasionally they stopped and glanced into his basket;
and Tharald noticed that they glowered unpleasantly at
him, whenever he had caught a fine fish. The fact was,
he had had extraordinary luck this week; for Mons was
getting to be such an expert, that he scarcely ever dived
without bringing something or other ashore.</p>

<p>He had almost money enough now to pay for a year’s
schooling, and he could scarcely sleep for joy when he
thought of the bright future that stretched out before
him. He saw himself in all manner of delightful situations.
Mons, in the meanwhile, who was not troubled
with this kind of ambition, snoozed peacefully in his
box, at the foot of his master’s bed. He did not dream
what a rude awakening was in store for him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It had been a very bad week for John Bamle and his
comrades. Morning after morning their traps were
empty, or one solitary fish lay sprawling at the bottom
of the box.</p>

<p>“I tell you, boys,” said John, spitting into his fist, and
shaking it threateningly against the sky, “I am bewitched;
that’s what I am. And so are you, boys&mdash;every
mother’s son of you. It is that Gimlehaug boy
that has bewitched us. Are you fools enough to suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
that it is a natural beast&mdash;that black thing&mdash;that trots
at his heels, and empties the river of its fish for his benefit?
Not by a jugful, lads&mdash;not by a big jugful! The
devil it is&mdash;the black Satan himself&mdash;or my name is not
John Bamle. You never saw a beast act like that before,
plunging into the yellow whirlpools, and coming back
unscathed every time, and with a fish as big as himself
dangling after him. Now, shall we stand that any
longer, boys? We have wives and babies at home, crying
for food! And here we come daily, and find empty
traps. Now wake up, lads, and be men! There has
come a day of reckoning for him who has sold himself
to the devil. I, for my part, am just mad enough to
venture on a tussle with old Nick himself.”</p>

<p>Every word that John uttered fell like a firebrand into
the men’s hearts. They shouted wildly, shook their fists,
and swung their long boat-hooks.</p>

<p>“We’ll kill him, the thief,” they cried, “the scoundrel!
He has sold himself to the devil.”</p>

<p>Up they rushed from the river-bank, up the green hillsides,
up the rocky slope, until they reached the gate at
Gimlehaug. It was but a small turf-thatched cottage,
with tiny lead-framed window-panes and a rude stone
chimney. The father was out working by the day, and
the two boys were at home alone. Tharald, who was
sitting at the window reading, felt suddenly a paw tapping
him on the cheek. It was Mons. In the same instant
an angry murmur of many voices reached his ear,
and he saw a crowd of excited fishermen, with boat-hooks
in their hands, thronging through the gate. There were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
twenty or thirty of them at the very least. Tharald
sprang forward and bolted the door. He knew why they
had come. Then he snatched Mons up in his arms, and
hugged him tightly.</p>

<p>“Let them do their worst, Mons,” he said; “whatever
happens, you and I will stand by each other.”</p>

<p>Anders, Tharald’s brother, came rushing in by the back
door. He, too, had seen the men coming.</p>

<p>“Hide yourself, hide yourself, Tharald!” he cried in
alarm; “it is you they are after.”</p>

<p>Hide yourself! That was more easily said than done.
The hut was now surrounded, and there was no escape.</p>

<p>“Climb up the chimney,” begged Anders; “hurry,
hurry! you have no time to lose.”</p>

<p>Happily there was no fire on the hearth, and Tharald,
still hugging Mons tightly, allowed himself to be pushed
by his brother up the sooty tunnel. Scarcely was Anders
again out on the floor, when there was a tremendous
thump at the door, so that the hut trembled.</p>

<p>“Open the door, I say!” shouted John Bamle without.</p>

<p>Anders, knowing how easily he could force the door, if
he wished, drew the bolt and opened.</p>

<p>“I want the salmon-fisher,” said John, fiercely.</p>

<p>“Yes, we want the salmon-fisher,” echoed the crowd,
wildly.</p>

<p>“What salmon-fisher?” asked Anders, with feigned
surprise.</p>

<p>“Don’t you try your tricks on me, you rascal,” yelled
John, furiously; and seizing the boy by the collar, flung
him out through the door. The crowd stormed in after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
him. They tore up the beds, and scattered the straw
over the floor; upset the furniture, ransacked drawers
and boxes. But no trace did they find of him whom
they sought. Then finally it occurred to someone to
look up the chimney, and a long boat-hook was thrust
up to bring down whatever there might be hidden there.
Tharald felt the sharp point in his thigh, and he knew
that he was discovered. With the strength of despair
he tore himself loose, leaving part of his trousers on the
hook, and, climbing upward, sprang out upon the roof.
His thigh was bleeding, but he scarcely noticed it. His
eyes and hair were full of soot, and his face was as black
as a chimney-sweep’s. The men, when they saw him,
jeered and yelled with derisive laughter.</p>

<p>“Hand us down your devilish beast there, and we
won’t hurt you!” cried John Bamle.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t,” answered Tharald.</p>

<p>“By the heavens, lad, if you don’t mind, it will go
hard with you.”</p>

<p>“I am not afraid,” said Tharald.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll make you, you beastly brat,” yelled a furious
voice in the crowd; and instantly a stone whistled
past the boy’s ear, and fell with a thump on the turf
below.</p>

<p>“Now, will you give up your beast?”</p>

<p>Tharald hesitated a moment. Should he give up
Mons, who had been his friend and playmate for two
years, and see him stoned to death by the cruel men?
Mons fixed his black, liquid eyes upon him as if he would
ask him that very question. No, no, he could not for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>sake
Mons. A second stone, bigger than the first, flew
past him, and he had to dodge quickly behind the chimney,
as the third and fourth followed.</p>

<p>“Tharald, Tharald!” cried Anders, imploringly; “do
let the otter go, or they will kill both you and him.”</p>

<p>Before Tharald could answer, a shower of stones fell
about him. One hit him in the forehead; the sparks
danced before his eyes. A warm current rushed down
his face; dizziness seized him; he fell, he did not know
where or how. John Bamle with a yell sprang forward,
climbed up the low wall to the roof, and saw the boy
lying, as if dead, behind the chimney. He turned to call
for his boat-hook, when suddenly something black shot
toward him from the chimney-top, and a set of terrible
teeth buried themselves in his throat. The mere force
of the leap made him lose his balance, and he tumbled
backward into the yard.</p>

<p>In the same instant Mons bounded forward, lighted
on somebody’s shoulder, and made for the woods. Before
anybody had time to think, he was out of sight.</p>

<p>Thus ended the famous battle of Gimlehaug, of which
the salmon-fishers yet speak in the valley. Or rather, I
should say, it did not end there, for John Bamle lay ill
for several weeks, and had to have his wound sewed up
by the doctor.</p>

<p>As for Tharald, he got well within a few days. But a
strange uneasiness came over him, and he roamed through
the woods early and late, seeking his lost friend. At the
end of a week, as he was sitting, one night, on the rocks
at the river, he suddenly felt something hairy rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
against his nose. He looked up, and with a scream of
joy clasped Mons in his arms. Then he hurried home,
and had a long talk with his father. And the end of it
was, that with the money which Mons had earned by his
salmon-fishing, tickets were bought for New York for the
entire family. About a month later they landed at Castle
Garden.</p>

<p>Tharald and Mons are now doing a large fish-business,
without fear of harm, in one of the great lakes of Wisconsin.
Some day, he hopes yet, it may lead to a parsonage.
Since he learned that some of the apostles were
fishermen, he feels that he is on the right road to the
goal of his ambition.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>“Iceland is the most beautiful land the sun doth
shine upon,” said Sigurd Sigurdson to his two sons.</p>

<p>“How can you know that, father,” asked Thoralf, the
elder of the two boys, “when you have never been anywhere
else?”</p>

<p>“I know it in my heart,” said Sigurd, devoutly.</p>

<p>“It is, after all, a matter of taste,” observed the son.
“I think if I were hard pressed, I might be induced to
put up with some other country.”</p>

<p>“You ought to blush with shame,” his father rejoined
warmly. “You do not deserve the name of an
Icelander, when you fail to see how you have been
blessed in having been born in so beautiful a country.”</p>

<p>“I wish it were less beautiful and had more things
to eat in it,” muttered Thoralf. “Salted codfish, I have
no doubt, is good for the soul, but it rests very heavily
on the stomach, especially when you eat it three times
a day.”</p>

<p>“You ought to thank God that you have codfish, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
are not a naked savage on some South Sea isle, who
feeds, like an animal, on the herbs of the earth.”</p>

<p>“But I like codfish much better than smoked puffin,”
remarked Jens, the younger brother, who was carving a
pipe-bowl. “Smoked puffin always makes me sea-sick.
It tastes like cod-liver oil.”</p>

<p>Sigurd smiled, and, patting the younger boy on the
head, entered the cottage.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t talk so to father, Thoralf,” said Jens,
with superior dignity; for his father’s caress made him
proud and happy. “Father works so hard, and he does
not like to see anyone discontented.”</p>

<p>“That is just it,” replied the elder brother; “he works
so hard, and yet barely manages to keep the wolf from
the door. That is what makes me impatient with the
country. If he worked so hard in any other country he
would live in abundance, and in America he would become
a rich man.”</p>

<p>This conversation took place one day, late in the
autumn, outside of a fisherman’s cottage on the north-western
coast of Iceland. The wind was blowing a gale
down from the ice-engirdled pole, and it required a
very genial temper to keep one from getting blue. The
ocean, which was but a few hundred feet distant, roared
like an angry beast, and shook its white mane of spray,
flinging it up against the black clouds. With every fresh
gust of wind, a shower of salt water would fly hissing
through the air and whirl about the chimney-top, which
was white on the windward side from dried deposits of
brine. On the turf-thatched roof big pieces of drift-wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
weighted down with stones, were laid lengthwise
and crosswise, and along the walls fishing-nets hung in
festoons from wooden pegs. Even the low door was
draped, as with decorative intent, with the folds of a
great drag-net, the clumsy cork-floats of which often
dashed into the faces of those who attempted to enter.
Under a driftwood shed which projected from the northern
wall was seen a pile of peat, cut into square blocks, and
a quantity of the same useful material might be observed
down at the beach, in a boat which the boys had been
unloading when the storm blew up. Trees no longer
grow in the island, except the crippled and twisted dwarf-birch,
which creeps along the ground like a snake, and,
if it ever dares lift its head, rarely grows more than four
or six feet high. In the olden time, which is described
in the so-called sagas of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
Iceland had very considerable forests of birch and
probably also of pine. But they were cut down; and
the climate has gradually been growing colder, until now
even the hardiest tree, if it be induced to strike root in a
sheltered place, never reaches maturity. The Icelanders
therefore burn peat, and use for building their houses
driftwood which is carried to them by the Gulf Stream
from Cuba and the other well-wooded isles along the
Mexican Gulf.</p>

<p>“If it keeps blowing like this,” said Thoralf, fixing his
weather eye on the black horizon, “we shan’t be able to
go a-fishing; and mother says the larder is very nearly
empty.”</p>

<p>“I wish it would blow down an Englishman or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>thing
on us,” remarked the younger brother; “Englishmen
always have such lots of money, and they are willing
to pay for everything they look at.”</p>

<p>“While you are a-wishing, why don’t you wish for an
American? Americans have mountains and mountains
of money, and they don’t mind a bit what they do with
it. That’s the reason I should like to be an American.”</p>

<p>“Yes, let us wish for an American or two to make us
comfortable for the winter. But I am afraid it is too
late in the season to expect foreigners.”</p>

<p>The two boys chatted together in this strain, each
working at some piece of wood-carving which he expected
to sell to some foreign traveller. Thoralf was sixteen
years old, tall of growth, but round-shouldered, from being
obliged to work when he was too young. He was
rather a handsome lad, though his features were square
and weather-beaten, and he looked prematurely old.
Jens, the younger boy, was fourteen years old, and was
his mother’s darling. For even up under the North Pole
mothers love their children tenderly, and sometimes they
love one a little more than another; that is, of course,
the merest wee bit of a fraction of a trifle more. Icelandic
mothers are so constituted that when one child is
a little weaker and sicklier than the rest, and thus seems
to be more in need of petting, they are apt to love their
little weakling above all their other children, and to
lavish the tenderest care upon that one. It was because
little Jens had so narrow a chest, and looked so small
and slender by the side of his robust brother, that his
mother always singled him out for favors and caresses.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>All night long the storm danced wildly about the cottage,
rattling the windows, shaking the walls, and making
fierce assaults upon the door, as if it meant to burst in.
Sometimes it bellowed hoarsely down the chimney, and
whirled the ashes on the hearth, like a gray snowdrift,
through the room. The fire had been put out, of course;
but the dancing ashes kept up a fitful patter, like that of
a pelting rainstorm, against the walls; they even penetrated
into the sleeping alcoves and powdered the heads
of their occupants. For in Iceland it is only well-to-do
people who can afford to have separate sleeping-rooms;
ordinary folk sleep in little closed alcoves, along the walls
of the sitting-room; masters and servants, parents and
children, guests and wayfarers, all retiring at night into
square little holes in the walls, where they undress behind
sliding trapdoors which may be opened again, when
the lights have been put out, and the supply of air
threatens to become exhausted. It was in a little closet
of this sort that Thoralf and Jens were lying, listening
to the roar of the storm. Thoralf dozed off occasionally,
and tried gently to extricate himself from his frightened
brother’s embrace; but Jens lay with wide-open eyes,
staring into the dark, and now and then sliding the trapdoor
aside and peeping out, until a blinding shower of
ashes would again compel him to slip his head under the
sheepskin coverlet. When at last he summoned courage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to peep out, he could not help shuddering. It was terribly
cheerless and desolate. And all the time his
father’s words kept ringing ironically in his ears:
“Iceland is the most beautiful land the sun doth shine
upon.” For the first time in his life he began to
question whether his father might not possibly be mistaken,
or, perhaps, blinded by his love for his country.
But the boy immediately repented of this doubt,
and, as if to convince himself in spite of everything,
kept repeating the patriotic motto to himself until he
fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was yet pitch dark in the room, when he was awakened
by his father, who stood stooping over him.</p>

<p>“Sleep on, child,” said Sigurd; “it was your brother
I wanted to wake up, not you.”</p>

<p>“What is the matter, father? What has happened?”
cried Jens, rising up in bed, and rubbing the ashes from
the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>“We are snowed up,” said the father, quietly. “It is
already nine o’clock, I should judge, or thereabouts, but
not a ray of light comes through the windows. I want
Thoralf to help me open the door.”</p>

<p>Thoralf was by this time awake, and finished his primitive
toilet with much despatch. The darkness, the damp
cold, and the unopened window-shutters impressed him
ominously. He felt as if some calamity had happened
or were about to happen. Sigurd lighted a piece of driftwood
and stuck it into a crevice in the wall. The storm
seemed to have ceased; a strange, tomb-like silence prevailed
without and within. On the hearth lay a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
snowdrift which sparkled with a starlike glitter in the
light.</p>

<p>“Bring the snow-shovels, Thoralf,” said Sigurd. “Be
quick; lose no time.”</p>

<p>“They are in the shed outside,” answered Thoralf.</p>

<p>“That is very unlucky,” said the father; “now we
shall have to use our fists.”</p>

<p>The door opened outward and it was only with the
greatest difficulty that father and son succeeded in pushing
it ajar. The storm had driven the snow with such
force against it that their efforts seemed scarcely to make
any impression upon the dense white wall which rose up
before them.</p>

<p>“This is of no earthly use, father,” said the boy; “it is
a day’s job at the very least. Let me rather try the
chimney.”</p>

<p>“But you might stick in the snow and perish,” objected
the father, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Weeds don’t perish so easily,” said Thoralf. “Stand
up on the hearth, father, and I will climb up on your
shoulders.”</p>

<p>Sigurd half reluctantly complied with his request.
Thoralf crawled up his back, and soon planted his feet
on the parental shoulders. He pulled his knitted woollen
cap over his eyes and ears so as to protect them
from the drizzling soot which descended in intermittent
showers. Then groping with his toes for a little projection
of the wall, he gained a securer foothold, and pushing
boldly on, soon thrust his sooty head through the snow-crust.
A chorus as of a thousand howling wolves burst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
upon his bewildered sense; the storm raged, shrieked,
roared, and nearly swept him off his feet. Its biting
breath smote his face like a sharp whip-lash.</p>

<p>“Give me my sheepskin coat,” he cried down into the
cottage; “the wind chills me to the bone.”</p>

<p>The sheepskin coat was handed to him on the end of
a pole, and seated upon the edge of the chimney, he
pulled it on and buttoned it securely. Then he rolled
up the edges of his cap in front and cautiously exposed
his eyes and the tip of his nose. It was not a pleasant
experiment, but one dictated by necessity. As far as he
could see, the world was white with snow, which the
storm whirled madly around, and swept now earthward,
now heavenward. Great funnel-shaped columns of snow
danced up the hillsides and vanished against the black
horizon. The prospect before the boy was by no means
inviting, but he had been accustomed to battle with dangers
since his earliest childhood, and he was not easily
dismayed. With much deliberation, he climbed over
the edge of the chimney, and rolled down the slope of
the roof in the direction of the shed. He might have
rolled a great deal farther, if he had not taken the precaution
to roll against the wind. When he had made
sure that he was in the right locality, he checked himself
by spreading his legs and arms; then judging by the
outline of the snow where the door of the shed was, he
crept along the edge of the roof on the leeward side. He
looked more like a small polar bear than a boy, covered,
as he was, with snow from head to foot. He was prepared
for a laborious descent, and raising himself up he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
jumped with all his might, hoping that his weight would
carry him a couple of feet down. To his utmost astonishment
he accomplished considerably more. The snow
yielded under his feet as if it had been eiderdown, and he
tumbled headlong into a white cave right at the entrance
to the shed. The storm, while it had packed the snow
on the windward side, had naturally scattered it very
loosely on the leeward, which left a considerable space
unfilled under the projecting eaves.</p>

<p>Thoralf picked himself up and entered the shed without
difficulty. He made up a large bundle of peat,
which he put into a basket which could be carried, by
means of straps, upon his back. With a snow-shovel he
then proceeded to dig a tunnel to the nearest window.
This was not a very hard task, as the distance was not
great. The window was opened and the basket of peat,
a couple of shovels, and two pairs of skees<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> (to be used
in case of emergency) were handed in. Thoralf himself,
who was hungry as a wolf, made haste to avail himself of
the same entrance. And it occurred to him as a happy
afterthought that he might have saved himself much
trouble, if he had selected the window instead of the
chimney when he sallied forth on his expedition. He
had erroneously taken it for granted that the snow would
be packed as hard everywhere as it was at the front door.
The mother, who had been spending this exciting half-hour
in keeping little Jens warm, now lighted a fire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
made coffee; and Thoralf needed no coaxing to do justice
to his breakfast, even though it had, like everything
else in Iceland, a flavor of salted fish.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Five days had passed, and still the storm raged with
unabated fury. The access to the ocean was cut off, and,
with that, access to food. Already the last handful of
flour had been made into bread, and of the dried cod
which hung in rows under the ceiling only one small
and skinny specimen remained. The father and the
mother sat with mournful faces at the hearth, the
former reading in his hymn-book, the latter stroking
the hair of her youngest boy. Thoralf, who was carving
at his everlasting pipe-bowl (a corpulent and short-legged
Turk with an enormous mustache), looked up
suddenly from his work and glanced questioningly at
his father.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, abruptly, “how would you like to
starve to death?”</p>

<p>“God will preserve us from that, my son,” answered
the father, devoutly.</p>

<p>“Not unless we try to preserve ourselves,” retorted
the boy, earnestly. “We can’t tell how long this storm
is going to last, and it is better for us to start out in
search of food now, while we are yet strong, than to wait
until later, when, as likely as not, we shall be weakened
by hunger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what would you have me do, Thoralf?” asked the
father, sadly. “To venture out on the ocean in this
weather would be certain death.”</p>

<p>“True; but we can reach the Pope’s Nose on our
skees, and there we might snare or shoot some auks and
gulls. Though I am not partial to that kind of diet myself,
it is always preferable to starvation.”</p>

<p>“Wait, my son, wait,” said Sigurd, earnestly. “We
have food enough for to-day, and by to-morrow the storm
will have ceased, and we may go fishing without endangering
our lives.”</p>

<p>“As you wish, father,” the son replied, a trifle hurt at
his father’s unresponsive manner; “but if you will take
a look out of the chimney, you will find that it looks
black enough to storm for another week.”</p>

<p>The father, instead of accepting this suggestion, went
quietly to his book-case, took out a copy of Livy, in
Latin, and sat down to read. Occasionally he looked
up a word in the lexicon (which he had borrowed from
the public library at Reykjavik), but read nevertheless
with apparent fluency and pleasure. Though he was a
fisherman, he was also a scholar, and during the long
winter evenings he had taught himself Latin and even a
smattering of Greek.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In Iceland the people have to
spend their evenings at home; and especially since
their millennial celebration in 1876, when American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
scholars<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> presented them with a large library, books are
their unfailing resource. In the case of Sigurd Sigurdson,
however, books had become a kind of dissipation, and
he had to be weaned gradually of his predilection for
Homer and Livy. His oldest son especially looked upon
Latin and Greek as a vicious indulgence, which no man
with a family could afford to foster. Many a day when
Sigurd ought to have been out in his boat casting his
nets, he stayed at home reading. And this, in Thoralf’s
opinion, was the chief reason why they would always remain
poor, and run the risk of starvation, whenever a
stretch of bad weather prevented them from going to sea.</p>

<p>The next morning&mdash;the sixth since the beginning of the
storm&mdash;Thoralf climbed up to his post of observation on
the chimney top, and saw, to his dismay, that his prediction
was correct. It had ceased snowing, but the wind
was blowing as fiercely as ever, and the cold was intense.</p>

<p>“Will you follow me, father, or will you not?” he
asked, when he had accomplished his descent into the
room. “Our last fish is now eaten, and our last loaf of
bread will soon follow suit.”</p>

<p>“I will go with you, my son,” answered Sigurd, putting
down his Livy reluctantly. He had just been reading
for the hundredth time about the expulsion of the
Tarquins from Rome, and his blood was aglow with
sympathy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>
<p>“Here is your coat, Sigurd,” said his wife, holding up
the great sheepskin garment, and assisting him in putting
it on.</p>

<p>“And here are your skees and your mittens and your
cap,” cried Thoralf, eager to seize the moment, when his
father was in the mood for action.</p>

<p>Muffled up like Esquimaux to their very eyes, armed
with bows and arrows and long poles with nooses of horse-hair
at the ends, they sallied forth on their skees. The
wind blew straight into their faces, forcing their breath
down their throats and compelling them to tack in zigzag
lines like ships in a gale. The promontory called “The
Pope’s Nose” was about a mile distant; but in spite of
their knowledge of the land, they went twice astray, and
had to lie down in the snow, every now and then, so as
to draw breath and warm the exposed portions of their
faces. At the end of nearly two hours they found themselves
at their destination, but, to their unutterable astonishment,
the ocean seemed to have vanished, and as far
as their eyes could reach, a vast field of packed ice
loomed up against the sky in fantastic bastions, turrets,
and spires. The storm had driven down this enormous
arctic wilderness from the frozen precincts of the pole;
and now they were blockaded on all sides, and cut off
from all intercourse with humanity.</p>

<p>“We are lost, Thoralf,” muttered his father, after
having gazed for some time in speechless despair at the
towering icebergs; “we might just as well have remained
at home.”</p>

<p>“The wind, which has blown the ice down upon us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
can blow it away again, too,” replied the son, with forced
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>“I see no living thing here,” said Sigurd, spying anxiously
seaward.</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” rejoined Thoralf; “but if we hunt, we
shall. I have brought a rope, and I am going to pay a
little visit to those auks and gulls that must be hiding in
the sheltered nooks of the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Are you mad, boy?” cried the father in alarm. “I
will never permit it!”</p>

<p>“There is no help for it, father,” said the boy resolutely.
“Here, you take hold of one end of the rope;
the other I will secure about my waist. Now, get a good
strong hold, and brace your feet against the rock there.”</p>

<p>Sigurd, after some remonstrance, yielded, as was his
wont, to his son’s resolution and courage. Stepping off
his skees, which he stuck endwise into the snow, and
burrowing his feet down until they reached the solid
rock, he tied the rope around his waist and twisted it
about his hands, and at last, with quaking heart, gave the
signal for the perilous enterprise. The promontory,
which rose abruptly to a height of two or three hundred
feet from the sea, presented a jagged wall full of nooks
and crevices glazed with frozen snow on the windward
side, but black and partly bare to leeward.</p>

<p>“Now let go!” shouted Thoralf; “and stop when I
give a slight pull at the rope.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied his father.</p>

<p>And slowly, slowly, hovering in mid-air, now yielding
to an irresistible impulse of dread, now brave, cautious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and confident, Thoralf descended the cliff, which no human
foot had ever trod before. He held in his hand the
pole with the horse-hair noose, and over his shoulder
hung a foxskin hunting-bag. With alert, wide-open
eyes he spied about him, exploring every cranny of the
rock, and thrusting his pole into the holes where he suspected
the birds might have taken refuge. Sometimes a
gust of wind would have flung him violently against the
jagged wall if he had not, by means of his pole, warded
off the collision. At last he caught sight of a bare ledge,
where he might gain a secure foothold; for the rope cut
him terribly about the waist, and made him anxious to
relieve the strain, if only for a moment. He gave the
signal to his father, and by the aid of the pole swung himself
over to the projecting ledge. It was uncomfortably
narrow, and, what was worse, the remnants of a dozen
auks’ nests had made the place extremely slippery.
Nevertheless, he seated himself, allowing his feet to
dangle, and gazed out upon the vast ocean, which looked
in its icy grandeur like a forest of shining towers and
minarets. It struck him for the first time in his life that
perhaps his father was right in his belief that Iceland was
the fairest land the sun doth shine upon; but he could
not help reflecting that it was a very unprofitable kind of
beauty. The storm whistled and howled overhead, but
under the lee of the sheltering rock it blew only in fitful
gusts with intermissions of comparative calm. He knew
that in fair weather this was the haunt of innumerable
sea birds, and he concluded that even now they could
not be far away. He pulled up his legs, and crept care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>fully
on hands and feet along the slippery ledge, peering
intently into every nook and crevice. His eyes, which
had been half-blinded by the glare of the snow, gradually
recovered their power of vision. There! What was
that? Something seemed to move on the ledge below.
Yes, there sat a long row of auks, some erect as soldiers,
as if determined to face it out; others huddled together
in clusters, and comically woe-begone. Quite a number
lay dead at the base of the rock, whether from starvation
or as the victims of fierce fights for the possession of the
sheltered ledges could scarcely be determined. Thoralf,
delighted at the sight of anything eatable (even though
it was poor eating), gently lowered the end of his pole,
slipped the noose about the neck of a large, military-looking
fellow, and, with a quick pull, swung him out
over the ice-field. The auk gave a few ineffectual flaps
with his useless wings,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and expired. His picking off
apparently occasioned no comment whatever in his
family, for his comrades never uttered a sound nor stirred
an inch, except to take possession of the place he had
vacated. Number two met his fate with the same listless
resignation; and numbers three, four, and five were
likewise removed in the same noiseless manner, without
impressing their neighbors with the fact that their turn
might come next. The birds were half-benumbed with
hunger, and their usually alert senses were drowsy and
stupefied. Nevertheless, number six, when it felt the
noose about its neck, raised a hubbub that suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
aroused the whole colony, and, with a chorus of wild
screams, the birds flung themselves down the cliffs or, in
their bewilderment, dashed headlong down upon the ice,
where they lay half stunned or helplessly sprawling. So,
through all the caves and hiding-places of the promontory
the commotion spread, and the noise of screams and
confused chatter mingled with the storm and filled the
vault of the sky. In an instant a great flock of gulls was
on the wing, and circled with resentful shrieks about the
head of the daring intruder who had disturbed their
wintry peace. The wind whirled them about, but they
still held their own, and almost brushed with their wings
against his face, while he struck out at them with his
pole. He had no intention of catching them; but, by
chance, a huge burgomaster gull<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> got its foot into the
noose. It made an ineffectual attempt to disentangle itself,
then, with piercing screams, flapped its great wings,
beating the air desperately. Thoralf, having packed
three birds into his hunting-bag, tied the three others together
by the legs, and flung them across his shoulders.
Then, gradually trusting his weight to the rope, he slid
off the rock, and was about to give his father the signal
to hoist him up. But, greatly to his astonishment, his
living captive, by the power of its mighty wings, pulling
at the end of the pole, swung him considerably farther
into space than he had calculated. He would have liked
to let go both the gull and the pole, but he perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
instantly that if he did, he would, by the mere force of his
weight, be flung back against the rocky wall. He did not
dare take that risk, as the blow might be hard enough to
stun him. A strange, tingling sensation shot through
his nerves, and the blood throbbed with a surging sound
in his ears. There he hung suspended in mid-air, over a
terrible precipice&mdash;and a hundred feet below was the
jagged ice-field with its sharp, fiercely-shining steeples!
With a powerful effort of will, he collected his senses,
clinched his teeth, and strove to think clearly. The gull
whirled wildly eastward and westward, and he swayed
with its every motion like a living pendulum between sea
and sky. He began to grow dizzy, but again his powerful
will came to his rescue, and he gazed resolutely up
against the brow of the precipice and down upon the projecting
ledges below, in order to accustom his eye and
his mind to the sight. By a strong effort he succeeded
in giving a pull at the rope, and expected to feel himself
raised upward by his father’s strong arms. But, to his
amazement, there came no response to his signal. He
repeated it once, twice, thrice; there was a slight tugging
at the rope, but no upward movement. Then the brave
lad’s heart stood still, and his courage wellnigh failed
him.</p>

<p>“Father!” he cried, with a hoarse voice of despair;
“why don’t you pull me up?”</p>

<p>His cry was lost in the roar of the wind, and there
came no answer. Taking hold once more of the rope
with one hand, he considered the possibility of climbing;
but the miserable gull, seeming every moment to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>double
its efforts at escape, deprived him of the use of
his hands unless he chose to dash out his brains by collision
with the rock. Something like a husky, choked
scream seemed to float down from above, and staring
again upward, he saw his father’s head projecting over
the brink of the precipice.</p>

<p>“The rope will break,” screamed Sigurd. “I have tied
it to the rock.”</p>

<p>Thoralf instantly took in the situation. By the swinging
motion, occasioned both by the wind and his fight
with the gull, the rope had become frayed against the
sharp edge of the cliff, and his chances of life, he coolly
concluded, were now not worth a sixpence. Curiously
enough, his agitation suddenly left him, and a great calm
came over him. He seemed to stand face to face with
eternity; and as nothing else that he could do was of
any avail, he could at least steel his heart to meet death
like a man and an Icelander.</p>

<p>“I am trying to get hold of the rope below the place
where it is frayed,” he heard his father shout during a
momentary lull in the storm.</p>

<p>“Don’t try,” answered the boy; “you can’t do it
alone. Rather, let me down on the lower ledge, and let
me sit there until you can go and get someone to help
you.”</p>

<p>His father, accustomed to take his son’s advice, reluctantly
lowered him ten or twenty feet until he was on a
level with the shelving ledge below, which was broader
than the one upon which he had first gained foothold.
But&mdash;oh, the misery of it!&mdash;the ledge did not project far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
enough! He could not reach it with his feet! The
rope, of which only a few strands remained, might break
at any moment and&mdash;he dared not think what would be
the result! He had scarcely had time to consider, when
a brilliant device shot through his brain. With a sudden
thrust he flung away the pole, and the impetus of his
weight sent him inward with such force that he landed
securely upon the broad shelf of rock.</p>

<p>The gull, surprised by the sudden weight of the pole,
made a somersault, strove to rise again, and tumbled,
with the pole still depending from its leg, down upon the
ice-field.</p>

<p>It was well that Thoralf was warmly clad, or he could
never have endured the terrible hours while he sat
through the long afternoon, hearing the moaning and
shrieking of the wind and seeing the darkness close
about him. The storm was chilling him with its fierce
breath. One of the birds he tied about his throat as a
sort of scarf, using the feet and neck for making the knot,
and the dense, downy feathers sent a glow of comfort
through him, in spite of his consciousness that every
hour might be his last. If he could only keep awake
through the night, the chances were that he would survive
to greet the morning. He hit upon an ingenious
plan for accomplishing this purpose. He opened the bill
of the auk which warmed his neck, cut off the lower
mandible, and placed the upper one (which was as sharp
as a knife) so that it would inevitably cut his chin in case
he should nod. He leaned against the rock and thought
of his mother and the warm, comfortable chimney-corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
at home. The wind probably resented this thought, for
it suddenly sent a biting gust right into his face,
and he buried his nose in the downy breast of the auk
until the pain had subsided. The darkness had now
settled upon sea and land; only here and there white
steeples loomed out of the gloom. Thoralf, simply to
occupy his thought, began to count them. But all of a
sudden one of the steeples seemed to move, then another&mdash;and
another.</p>

<p>The boy feared that the long strain of excitement was
depriving him of his reason. The wind, too, after a few
wild arctic howls, acquired a warmer breath and a gentler
sound. It could not be possible that he was dreaming,
for in that case he would soon be dead. Perhaps he
was dead already, and was drifting through this strange
icy vista to a better world. All these imaginings flitted
through his mind, and were again dismissed as improbable.
He scratched his face with the foot of an auk in
order to convince himself that he was really awake.
Yes, there could be no doubt of it; he was wide awake.
Accordingly he once more fixed his eyes upon the ghostly
steeples and towers, and&mdash;it sent cold shudders down his
back&mdash;they were still moving. Then there came a fusillade
as of heavy artillery, followed by a salvo of lighter
musketry; then came a fierce grinding, and cracking,
and creaking sound, as if the whole ocean were of glass
and were breaking to pieces. “What,” thought Thoralf,
“is the ice breaking up!” In an instant the explanation
of the whole spectral panorama was clear as
the day. The wind had veered round to the southeast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and the whole enormous ice-floe was being driven out to
sea. For several hours&mdash;he could not tell how many&mdash;he
sat watching this superb spectacle by the pale light of
the aurora borealis, which toward midnight began to
flicker across the sky and illuminated the northern horizon.
He found the sight so interesting that for a while
he forgot to be sleepy. But toward morning, when the
aurora began to fade and the clouds to cover the east,
a terrible weariness was irresistibly stealing over him.
He could see glimpses of the black water beneath him;
and the shining spires of ice were vanishing in the dusk,
drifting rapidly away upon the arctic currents with
death and disaster to ships and crews that might happen
to cross their paths.</p>

<p>It was terrible at what a snail’s pace the hours
crept along! It seemed to Thoralf as if a week had
passed since his father left him. He pinched himself
in order to keep awake, but it was of no use; his eyelids
would slowly droop and his head would incline&mdash;horrors!
what was that? Oh, he had forgotten; it
was the sharp mandible of the auk that cut his chin.
He put his hand up to it, and felt something warm
and clammy on his fingers. He was bleeding. It
took Thoralf several minutes to stay the blood&mdash;the
wound was deeper than he had bargained for; but it
occupied him and kept him awake, which was of vital
importance.</p>

<p>At last, after a long and desperate struggle with
drowsiness, he saw the dawn break faintly in the east.
It was a mere feeble promise of light, a remote sugges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>tion
that there was such a thing as day. But to the boy,
worn out by the terrible strain of death and danger staring
him in the face, it was a glorious assurance that rescue
was at hand. The tears came into his eyes&mdash;not
tears of weakness, but tears of gratitude that the terrible
trial had been endured. Gradually the light spread like
a pale, grayish veil over the eastern sky, and the ocean
caught faint reflections of the presence of the unseen sun.
The wind was mild, and thousands of birds that had been
imprisoned by the ice in the crevices of the rocks whirled
triumphantly into the air and plunged with wild screams
into the tide below. It was hard to imagine where they
all had been, for the air seemed alive with them, the cliffs
teemed with them; and they fought, and shrieked, and
chattered, like a howling mob in times of famine. It
was owing to this unearthly tumult that Thoralf did not
hear the voice which called to him from the top of the
cliff. His senses were half-dazed by the noise and by
the sudden relief from the excitement of the night.
Then there came two voices floating down to him&mdash;then
quite a chorus. He tried to look up, but the beetling
brow of the rock prevented him from seeing anything
but a stout rope, which was dangling in mid-air and
slowly approaching him. With all the power of his lungs
he responded to the call; and there came a wild cheer
from above&mdash;a cheer full of triumph and joy. He recognized
the voices of Hunding’s sons, who lived on the
other side of the promontory; and he knew that even
without their father they were strong enough to pull up
a man three times his weight. The difficulty now was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
only to get hold of the rope, which hung too far out for
his hands to reach it.</p>

<p>“Shake the rope hard,” he called up; and immediately
the rope was shaken into serpentine undulations; and
after a few vain efforts, he succeeded in catching hold of
the knot. To secure the rope about his waist and to give
the signal for the ascent was but a moment’s work.
They hauled vigorously, those sons of Hunding&mdash;for he
rose, up, along the black walls&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;up&mdash;with no
uncertain motion. At last, when he was at the very
brink of the precipice, he saw his father’s pale and anxious
face leaning out over the abyss. But there was another
face too! Whose could it be? It was a woman’s
face. It was his mother’s. Somebody swung him out
into space; a strange, delicious dizziness came over him;
his eyes were blinded with tears; he did not know where
he was. He only knew that he was inexpressibly happy.
There came a tremendous cheer from somewhere&mdash;for
Icelanders know how to cheer&mdash;but it penetrated but
faintly through his bewildered senses. Something cold
touched his forehead; it seemed to be snow; then warm
drops fell, which were tears. He opened his eyes; he
was in his mother’s arms. Little Jens was crying over
him and kissing him. His father and Hunding’s sons
were standing, with folded arms, gazing joyously at him.</p>

<h2><a name="MIKKEL" id="MIKKEL"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">MIKKEL.</a></h2>


<h3>I.<br /><br /><br />

<span class="fs70">HOW MIKKEL WAS FOUND.</span></h3>

<p>You may find it hard to believe what I am going to
tell you, but it is, nevertheless, strictly true. I knew the
boy who is the hero of this story. His name was Thor
Larsson, and a very clever boy he was. Still I don’t
think he would have amounted to much in the world, if
it had not been for his friend Michael, or, as they write
it in Norwegian, Mikkel. Mikkel, strange to say, was
not a boy, but a fox. Thor caught him, when he was a
very small lad, in a den under the roots of a huge tree.
It happened in this way. Thor and his elder brother,
Lars, and still another boy, named Ole Thomlemo, were up
in the woods gathering faggots, which they tied together
in large bundles to carry home on their backs; for their
parents were poor people, and had no money to buy wood
with. The boys rather liked to be sent on errands of
this kind, because delicious raspberries and blueberries
grew in great abundance in the woods, and gathering
faggots was, after all, a much manlier occupation than
staying at home minding the baby.</p>

<p>Thor’s brother Lars and Ole Thomlemo were great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
friends, and they had a disagreeable way of always plotting
and having secrets together and leaving Thor out of
their councils. One of their favorite tricks, when they
wished to get rid of him, was to pretend to play hide-and-seek;
and when he had hidden himself, they would run
away from him and make no effort to find him. It was
this trick of theirs which led to the capture of Mikkel,
and to many things besides.</p>

<p>It was on a glorious day in the early autumn that the
three boys started out together, as frisky and gay as a
company of squirrels. They had no luncheon-baskets
with them, although they expected to be gone for the
whole day; but they had hooks and lines in their pockets,
and meant to have a famous dinner of brook-trout
up in some mountain glen, where they could sit like
pirates around a fire, conversing in mysterious language,
while the fish was being fried upon a flat stone. Their
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">tolle</i> knives<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> were hanging, sheathed, from their girdles,
and the two older ones carried, besides, little hatchets
wherewith to cut off the dry twigs and branches. Lars
and Ole Thomlemo, as usual, kept ahead and left Thor
to pick his way over the steep and stony road as best he
might; and when he caught up with them, they started
to run, while he sat down panting on a stone. Thus
several hours passed, until they came to a glen in which
the blueberries grew so thickly that you couldn’t step
without crushing a handful. The boys gave a shout of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
delight and flung themselves down, heedless of their
clothes, and began to eat with boyish greed. As far as
their eyes could reach between the mossy pine trunks,
the ground was blue with berries, except where bunches
of ferns or clusters of wild flowers intercepted the view.
When they had dulled the edge of their hunger, they began
to cut the branches from the trees which the lumbermen
had felled, and Ole Thomlemo, who was clever
with his hands, twisted withes, which they used instead
of ropes for tying their bundles together. They had
one bundle well secured and another under way, when
Ole, with a mischievous expression, ran over to Lars and
whispered something in his ear.</p>

<p>“Let us play hide-and-seek,” said Lars aloud, glancing
over toward his little brother, who was working like a
Trojan, breaking the faggots so as to make them all the
same length.</p>

<p>Thor, who in spite of many exasperating experiences
had not yet learned to be suspicious, threw down an
armful of dry boughs and answered: “Yes, let us, boys.
I am in for anything.”</p>

<p>“I’ll blind first,” cried Ole Thomlemo; “now, be
quick and get yourselves hidden.”</p>

<p>And off the two brothers ran, while Ole turned his
face against a big tree and covered his eyes with his
hands. But the very moment Thor was out of sight,
Lars stole back again to his friend, and together they
slipped away under cover of the bushes, until they
reached the lower end of the glen. There, they pulled
out their fish-lines, cut rods with their hatchets, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
down to the tarn, or brook, which was only a short distance
off; the fishing was excellent, and when the large
speckled trout began to leap out of the water to catch
their flies, the two boys soon ceased to trouble themselves
about little Thor, who, they supposed, was hiding
under some bush and waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>In this supposition they were partly right and partly
wrong.</p>

<p>No sooner had Ole Thomlemo given the signal for
hiding, than Thor ran up the hill-side, stumbling over
the moss-grown stones, pushing the underbrush aside
with his hands, and looking eagerly for a place where he
would be least likely to be found. He was full of the
spirit of the game, and anticipated with joyous excitement
the wonder of the boys when they should have to
give up the search and call to him to reveal himself.
While these thoughts were filling his brain, he caught
sight of a huge old fir-tree, which was leaning down the
mountain-side as if ready to fall. The wind had evidently
given it a pull in the top, strong enough to loosen
its hold on the ground, and yet not strong enough to
overthrow it. On the upper side, for a dozen yards or
more, the thick, twisted roots, with the soil and turf still
clinging to them, had been lifted, so as to form a little
den about two feet wide at the entrance. Here, thought
Thor, was a wonderful hiding-place. Chuckling to himself
at the discomfiture of his comrades, he threw himself
down on his knees and thrust his head into the opening.
To his surprise the bottom felt soft to his hands,
as if it had been purposely covered with moss and a layer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of feathers and eider-down. He did not take heed of the
peculiar wild smell which greeted his nostrils, but fearlessly
pressed on, until nearly his whole figure, with the
exception of the heels of his boots, was hidden. Then a
sharp little bark startled him, and raising his head he saw
eight luminous eyes staring at him from a dark recess, a
few feet beyond his nose. It is not to be denied that he
was a little frightened; for it instantly occurred to him
that he had unwittingly entered the den of some wild
beast, and that, in case the old ones were at home, there
was small chance of his escaping with a whole skin. It
could hardly be a bear’s den, for the entrance was not
half big enough for a gentleman of Bruin’s size. It might
possibly be a wolf’s premises he was trespassing upon,
and the idea made his blood run cold. For Mr. Gray-legs,
as the Norwegians call the wolf, is not to be trifled
with; and a small boy armed only with a knife was
hardly a match for such an antagonist. Thor concluded,
without much reflection, that his safest plan would be to
beat a hasty retreat. Digging his hands into the mossy
ground, he tried to push himself backward, but, to his
unutterable dismay, he could not budge an inch. The
feathers, interspersed with the smooth pine-needles,
slipped away under his fingers, and the roots caught
in his clothes and held him as in a vice. He tried to
force his way, but the more he wriggled the more he
realized how small was his chance of escape. To turn
was impossible, and to pull off his coat and trousers was
a scarcely less difficult task. It was fortunate that the
four inhabitants of the den, to whom the glaring eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
belonged, seemed no less frightened than himself; for
they remained huddled together in their corner, and
showed no disposition to fight. They only stared wildly
at the intruder, and seemed anxious to know what he
intended to do next. And Thor stared at them in return,
although the darkness was so dense that he could
discern nothing except the eight luminous eyes, which
were fixed upon him with an uncanny and highly uncomfortable
expression. Unpleasant as the situation
was, he began to grow accustomed to it, and he collected
his scattered thoughts sufficiently to draw certain conclusions.
The size of the den, as well as the feathers
which everywhere met his fumbling hands, convinced
him that his hosts were young foxes, and that probably
their respected parents, for the moment, were on a raid
in search of rabbits or stray poultry. That reflection
comforted him, for he had never known a fox to use any
other weapon of defence than its legs, unless it was
caught in a trap and had to fight for bare life. He was
just dismissing from his mind all thought of danger from
that source, when a sudden sharp pain in his heel put an
end to his reasoning. He gave a scream, at which the
eight eyes leaped apart in pairs and distributed themselves
in a row along the curving wall of the den. Another
bite in his ankle convinced him that he was being
attacked from behind, and he knew no other way of defence
than to kick with all his might, screaming at the
same time so as to attract the attention of the boys, who,
he supposed, could hardly be far off. But his voice
sounded choked and feeble in the close den, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
feared that no one would be able to hear it ten yards
away. The strong odor, too, began to stifle him, and a
strange dizziness wrapped his senses, as it were, in a gray,
translucent veil. He made three or four spasmodic efforts
to rouse himself, screamed feebly, and kicked; but
probably he struck his wounded ankle against a root or
a stone, for the pain shot up his leg and made him clinch
his teeth to keep the tears from starting. He thought
of his poor mother, whom he feared he should never see
again, and how she would watch for his return through
the long night and cry for him, as it said in the Bible
that Jacob cried over Joseph when he supposed that a
wild beast had torn him to pieces and killed him. Curious
lights, like shooting stars, began to move before his
eyes; his tongue felt dry and parched, and his throat
seemed burning hot. It occurred to him that certainly
God saw his peril and might yet help him, if he only
prayed for help; but the only prayer which he could remember
was the one which the minister repeated every
Sunday for “our most gracious sovereign, Oscar II.,
and the army and navy of the United Kingdoms.” Next
he stumbled upon “the clergy, and the congregations
committed to their charge;” and he was about to finish
with “sailors in distress at sea,” when his words, like his
thoughts, grew more and more hazy, and he drifted away
into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Lars and Ole Thomlemo in the meanwhile had enjoyed
themselves to the top of their bent, and when they
had caught a dozen trout, among which was one three-pounder,
they reeled up their lines, threaded the fish on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
withes, and began to trudge leisurely up the glen. When
they came to the place where they had left their bundles
of faggots, they stopped to shout for Thor, and when
they received no reply, they imagined that, being tired
of waiting, he had gone home alone, or fallen in with
some one who was on his way down to the valley. The
only thing that troubled them was that Thor’s bundle
had not been touched since they left him, and they knew
that the boy was not lazy, and that, moreover, he would
be afraid to go home without the faggots. They therefore
concluded to search the copse and the surrounding
underbrush, as it was just possible that he might have
fallen asleep in his hiding-place while waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>“I think Thor is napping somewhere under the
bushes,” cried Ole Thomlemo, swinging his hatchet
over his head like an Indian tomahawk. “We shall
have to halloo pretty loud, for you know he sleeps like
a top.”</p>

<p>And they began scouring the underbrush, traversing
it in all directions, and hallooing lustily, both singly and
in chorus. They were just about giving up the quest,
when Lars’s attention was attracted by two foxes which,
undismayed by the noise, were running about a large
fir-tree, barking in a way which betrayed anxiety, and
stopping every minute to dig up the ground with their
fore-paws. When the boys approached the tree, the
foxes ran only a short distance, then stopped, ran back,
and again fled, once more to return.</p>

<p>“Those fellows act very queerly,” remarked Lars, eying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the foxes curiously; “I’ll wager there are young un’s
under the tree here, but”&mdash;Lars gasped for breath&mdash;“Ole&mdash;Ole&mdash;Oh,
look! What is this?”</p>

<p>Lars had caught sight of a pair of heels, from which a
little stream of blood had been trickling, coloring the
stones and pine-needles. Ole Thomlemo, hearing his
comrade’s exclamation of fright, was on the spot in an
instant, and he comprehended at once how everything
had happened.</p>

<p>“Look here, Lars,” he said, resolutely, “this is no
time for crying. If Thor is dead, it is we who have
killed him; but if he isn’t dead, we’ve got to save
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what shall we do, Ole?” sobbed Lars, while the
tears rolled down over his cheeks, “what shall we do? I
shall never dare go home again if he is dead. We have
been so very bad to him!”</p>

<p>“We have got to save him, I tell you,” repeated Ole,
tearless and stern: “we must pull him out; and if we
can’t do that, we must cut through the roots of this fir-tree;
then it’ll plunge down the mountain-side, without
hurting him. A few roots that have burrowed into the
rocks are all that keep the tree standing. Now, act like
a man. Take hold of him by one heel and I’ll take the
other.”</p>

<p>Lars, who looked up to his friend as a kind of superior
being, dried his tears and grasped his brother’s foot, while
Ole carefully handled the wounded ankle. But their
combined efforts had no perceptible effect, except to
show how inextricably the poor lad’s clothes were inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>tangled
with the tree-roots, which, growing all in one direction,
made entrance easy, but exit impossible.</p>

<p>“That won’t do,” said Ole, after three vain trials. “We
might injure him without knowing it, driving the sharp
roots into his eyes and ears, as likely as not. We’ve got
to use the hatchets. You cut that root and I’ll manage
this one.”</p>

<p>Ole Thomlemo was a lumberman’s son, and since he
was old enough to walk had spent his life in the forest.
He could calculate with great nicety how a tree would
fall, if cut in a certain way, and his skill in this instance
proved valuable. With six well-directed cuts he severed
one big root, while Lars labored at a smaller one. Soon
with a great crash the mighty tree fell down the mountain-side,
crushing a dozen birches and smaller pines
under its weight. The moss-grown sod around about
was torn up with the remaining roots, and three pretty
little foxes, blinded and stunned by the rush of daylight,
sprang out from their hole and stared in bewilderment
at the sudden change of scene. Through the cloud of
flying dust and feathers the boys discerned, too, Thor’s
insensible form, lying outstretched, torn and bleeding,
his face resting upon his hands, as if he were asleep.
With great gentleness they lifted him up, brushed the
moss and earth from his face and clothes, and placed
him upon the grass by the side of the brook which flowed
through the bottom of the glen. Although his body was
warm, they could hardly determine whether he was dead
or alive, for he seemed scarcely to be breathing, and it
was not until Ole put a feather before his mouth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
perceived its faint inward and outward movement, that
they felt reassured and began to take heart. They
bathed his temples with the cool mountain water and
rubbed and chafed his hands, until at last he opened his
eyes wonderingly and moved his lips, as if endeavoring
to speak.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he whispered at last, after several
vain efforts to make himself heard.</p>

<p>“Why, cheer up, old fellow,” answered Ole, encouragingly;
“you have had a little accident, that’s all, but
you’ll be all right in a minute.”</p>

<p>“Unbutton my vest,” whispered Thor again; “there is
something scratching me here.”</p>

<p>He put his hand over his heart, and the boys quickly
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: ‘tore his watstcoat’">tore his waistcoat</ins> open, but to their unutterable astonishment
a little fox, the image of the three that had escaped,
put his head out and looked about him with his alert
eyes, as if to say: “Here am I; how do you like me?”
He evidently felt so comfortable where he was, that he
had no desire to get away. No doubt the little creature,
prompted either by his curiosity or a desire to escape
from the den, had crept into Thor’s bosom while he was
insensible, and, finding his quarters quite to his taste,
had concluded to remain. Lars picked him up, tied a
string about his neck, and put him in the side pocket of
his jacket. Then, as it was growing late, Ole lifted Thor
upon his back, and he and Lars took turns in carrying
him down to the valley.</p>

<p>Thor’s ankle gave him some trouble, as the wound
was slow in healing. With that exception, he was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
himself again; and he and Mikkel (for that was the
name he gave to the little fox) grew to be great friends
and had many a frolic together.</p>

<p>But the little fox was not a model of deportment, as
you will see when I tell you, in the next chapter, how
Mikkel disgraced himself.</p>


<hr class="tb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.<br /><br /><br />

<span class="fs70">HOW MIKKEL DISGRACED HIMSELF.</span></h3>

<p>When Thor was twelve years old, he had to go out
into the world to make his own living; for his parents
were poor, and they had half a dozen younger children,
who also had to be fed and clothed. As it happened,
Judge Nannestad, who lived on a large estate down at
the fiord, wanted an office-boy, and as Thor was a bright
and active lad, he had no difficulty in obtaining the situation.
The only question was, how to dispose of Mikkel;
for, to be frank, Mikkel (in spite of his many admirable
traits) was not a general favorite, and Thor suspected
that when his protector was away Mikkel would have a
hard time of it. He well knew that Mikkel was of a
peculiar temperament, which required to be studied in
order to be appreciated, and as there was no one but himself
who took this trouble, he did not wonder that his
friend was generally misunderstood. Mikkel’s was not a
nature to invite confidences; he scrupulously kept his
own counsel, and was always alert and on his guard.
There was a bland expression on his face, a kind of lurking
smile, which never varied, and which gave absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
no clew to his thoughts. When he had skimmed the
cream off the milk-pans on the top shelf in the kitchen,
he returned, licking his chops, with the same inscrutable
smile, as if his conscience were as clean as a new-born
babe’s; and when he had slipped his collar over his head
and dispatched the kitten, burying its remains in the
backyard, he betrayed no more remorse than if he had
been cracking a nut. Sultan, the dog, strange to say,
had private reasons for being afraid of him, and always
slank away in a shamefaced manner, whenever Mikkel
gave him one of his quiet sidelong glances. And yet
the same Mikkel would roll on his back, and jump and
play with the baby by the hour, seize her pudgy little
hands gently with his teeth, never inflicting a bite or
a scratch. He would nestle on Thor’s bosom inside
of his coat, while Thor was learning his lesson, or he
would sit on his shoulder and look down on the book
with his superior smile. It was not to be denied that
Mikkel had a curious character&mdash;an odd mixture of
good and bad qualities; but as, in Thor’s judgment,
the good were by far the more prominent, he would
not listen to his father’s advice and leave his friend
behind him, when he went down to the judge’s at the
grand estate.</p>

<p>It was the day after New-year’s that Thor left the cottage
up under the mountain, and, putting on his skees,
slid down the steep hill-side to the fiord. Mikkel was
nestling, according to his wont, in the bosom of his master’s
coat, while his pretty head, with the clean dark
snout and dark mustache, was sticking out above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
boy’s collar, just under his chin. Mikkel had never
been so far away from home before, and he concluded
that the world was a bigger affair than he had been
aware of.</p>

<p>It was with a loudly thumping heart that Thor paused
outside the door of the judge’s office, for he greatly
feared that the judge might share the general prejudice
against Mikkel, and make difficulties about his board
and lodgings. Instead of entering, he went to the pump
in the yard and washed his friend’s face carefully and
combed his hair with the fragment of a comb with which
his mother had presented him at parting. It was important
that Mikkel should appear to advantage, so as to
make a good impression upon the judge. And really he
did look irresistible, Thor thought, with his bright, black
eyes, his dainty paws, and his beautiful red skin. He
felt satisfied that if the judge had not a heart of stone
he could not help being captivated at the sight of so
lovely a creature. Thor took courage and knocked at
the door.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are our new office-boy,” said the judge, as
he entered; “but what is that you have under your
coat?”</p>

<p>“It is Mikkel, sir, please your Honor,” stammered
Thor, putting the fox on the floor, so as to display his
charms. But hardly had he taken his hands off him,
when a sudden scrambling noise was heard in the adjoining
office, and a large hound came bounding with
wild eyes and drooping tongue through the open door.
With lightning speed Mikkel leaped up on the judge’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
writing-desk, scattering his writing materials, upsetting
an inkstand by an accidental whisk of his tail, and bespattering
the honorable gentleman’s face and shirt-front
with the black fluid. To perform a similar service
on the next desk, where a clerk was writing, to jump
from there to the shoulder of a marble bust, which fell
from its pedestal down on the hound’s head and broke
into a dozen pieces, and to reach a place of safety on
the top of a tall bookcase were all a moment’s work.
The hound lay howling, with a wounded nose, on the
floor. The judge stood scowling at his desk, rubbing
the ink all over his face with his handkerchief, and
Mikkel sat smiling on the top of the bookcase, surveying
calmly the ruin which he had wrought. But the
most miserable creature in the room was neither the
judge, with his black face, nor the hound, with the bleeding
nose; it was Thor, who stood trembling at the door,
expecting that something still more terrible would happen.
And knowing that, after having caused such a commotion,
his place was forfeited, he held out his arms to
Mikkel, who accepted the invitation, and with all speed
at their disposal they rushed out through the door and
away over the snowy fields, scarcely knowing whither
their feet bore them.</p>

<p>After half an hour’s run, when he had no more breath
left, Thor seated himself on a tree-stump and tried to
collect his thoughts. What should he now do? Where
should he turn? Go home he could not; and if he did,
it would be the end of Mikkel. The only thing he could
think of was to go around in the parish, from farm to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
farm, until he found somebody who would give him something
to do.</p>

<p>“I hope you will appreciate, my dear Mikkel,” he said
to his fox, “that it is on your account I have all this
trouble. It was very naughty of you to behave so badly,
and if you do it again I shall have to whip you! Do
you understand that, Mikkel?”</p>

<p>Mikkel looked sheepish, which plainly showed that he
understood.</p>

<p>“Now, Mikkel,” Thor continued, “we will go to the
parson; perhaps he may have some use for us. What
do you think of trying the parson?”</p>

<p>Mikkel apparently thought well of the parson, for he
licked his master behind his ear and rubbed his snout
against his cheek. Accordingly, by noon they reached
the parsonage, and after a long parley with the pastor’s
wife, he was engaged as a sort of errand-boy, whose duty
it should be to do odd jobs about the house. Mikkel
was to have a kennel provided for him in the stable, but
was under no circumstances to enter the house. Thor
had to vouch for his good behavior, and the moment he
made himself in any way obnoxious it was decided that
he should be killed. Poor Thor had nominally to accept
these hard conditions, but in his own mind he determined
to run away with Mikkel the moment he was
caught in any kind of mischief. It seemed very hard for
Mikkel, too, who had been accustomed to sleep in Thor’s
arms in his warm bed, to be chained, and to spend the
long, dark nights in the stable in a miserable kennel.
Nevertheless, there was no help for it; so Thor went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
work that same afternoon and made Mikkel as comfortable
a kennel as he could, taking care to make the hole
which served for entrance no bigger than it had to
be, so that no dog or other enemy should be able to
enter.</p>

<p>For about four months all went well at the parsonage.
So long as Mikkel was confined in the stable he behaved
himself with perfect propriety, and, occasionally, when
he was (by special permission) taken into the house to
play with the children, he won golden opinions for himself
by his cunning tricks, and became, in fact, a great
favorite in the nursery. When the spring came and the
sun grew warm, his kennel was, at Thor’s request, moved
out into the yard, where he could have the benefit of the
fine spring weather. There he could be seen daily, lying
in the sun, with half-closed eyes, resting his head on his
paws, seeming too drowsy and comfortable to take notice
of anything. The geese and hens, which were at first a
trifle suspicious, gradually grew accustomed to his presence,
and often strayed within range of Mikkel’s chain,
and even within reach of his paws; but it always happened
that on such occasions either the pastor or his
wife was near, and Mikkel knew enough to be aware that
goose was forbidden fruit. But one day (it was just after
dinner, when the pastor was taking his nap), it happened
that a great fat gander, prompted by a pardonable curiosity,
stretched his neck a little too far toward the sleeping
Mikkel; when, quick as a wink and wide-awake, Mr.
Mikkel jumped up, and before he knew it, the gander
found himself minus his head. Very cautiously the cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>prit
peered about, and seeing no one near, he rapidly dug
a hole under his kennel and concealed his victim there,
covering it well with earth, until a more favorable opportunity
should present itself for making a meal of it.
Then he lay down, and stretched himself in the sun as
before, and seemed too sleepy even to open his eyes;
and when, on the following day, the gander was missed,
the innocent demeanor of Mikkel so completely imposed
upon everyone, that he was not even suspected.
Not even when the second and the third goose disappeared
could any reasonable charge be brought against
Mikkel.</p>

<p>When the summer vacation came, however, the even
tenor of Mikkel’s existence was rudely interrupted by
the arrival of the parson’s oldest son, Finn, who was a
student in Christiania, and his dog Achilles. Achilles
was a handsome brown pointer, that, having been
brought up in the city, had never been accustomed to
look upon the fox as a domestic animal. He, therefore,
spent much of his time in harassing Mikkel, making
sudden rushes for him when he thought him asleep;
but always returning from these exploits shamefaced
and discomfited, for Mikkel was always a great deal too
clever to be taken by surprise. He would lie perfectly
still until Achilles was within a foot of him, and then,
with remarkable alertness, he would slip into the kennel,
through his door, where the dog’s size would not
permit him to follow; and the moment his enemy
turned his tail to him, Mikkel’s face would appear
bland and smiling, at the door, as if to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-by! Call again whenever you feel like it.
Now, don’t you wish you were as clever as I am?”</p>

<p>And yet in spite of his daily defeats, Achilles could
never convince himself that his assaults upon Mikkel
brought him no glory. Perhaps his master, who did not
like Mikkel any too well, encouraged him in his enmity,
for it is certain that the assaults grew fiercer daily. And
at last, one day when the young student was standing in
the yard, holding his dog by the collar, while exciting
him against the half-sleeping fox, Achilles ran with such
force against the kennel that he upset it. Alas! For
then the evidence of Mikkel’s misdemeanors came to
light. From the door-hole of the rolling kennel a heap
of goose-feathers flew out, and were scattered in the air;
and, what was worse, a little “dug-out” became visible,
filled with bones and bills and other indigestible articles,
unmistakably belonging to the goose’s anatomy. Mikkel,
who was too wise to leave the kennel so long as it was
in motion, now peeped cautiously out, and he took in
the situation at a glance. Mr. Finn, the student, who
thought that Mikkel’s skin would look charming as a
rug before his fire-place in the city, was overjoyed to find
out what a rascal this innocent-looking creature had been;
for he knew well enough that his father would now no
longer oppose his desire for the crafty little creature’s
skin. So he went into the house, loaded his rifle, and
prepared himself as executioner.</p>

<p>But at that very moment, Thor chanced to be coming
home from an errand; and he had hardly entered the
yard, when he sniffed danger in the air. He knew, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>out
asking, that Mikkel’s doom was sealed. For the
parson was a great poultry-fancier and was said to be
more interested in his ganders than he was in his children.
Therefore, without waiting for further developments,
Thor unhooked Mikkel’s chain, lifted the culprit
in his arms, and slipped him into the bosom of his waistcoat.
Then he stole up to his garret, gathered his clothes
in a bundle, and watched his chance to escape from the
house unnoticed. And while Master Finn and his dog
were hunting high and low for Mikkel in the barns and
stables, Thor was hurrying away over the fields, every
now and then glancing anxiously behind him, and nearly
smothering Mikkel in his efforts to keep him concealed,
lest Achilles should catch his scent. But Mikkel had
his own views on that subject, and was not to be suppressed;
and just as his master was congratulating himself
on their happy escape, they heard the deep baying
of a dog, and saw Achilles, followed by the student with
his gun, tracking them in fierce pursuit. Thor, whose
only hope was to reach the fiord, redoubled his speed,
skipped across fences, hedges, and stiles, and ran so fast
that earth and stones seemed to be flying in the other
direction. Yet Achilles’ baying was coming nearer and
nearer, and was hardly twenty feet distant by the
time the boy had flung himself into a boat, and with
four vigorous oar-strokes had shot out into the water.
The dog leaped after him, but was soon beyond his
depth, and the high breakers flung him back upon the
beach.</p>

<p>“Come back at once,” cried Finn, imperiously. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is not your boat. If you don’t obey, I’ll have you arrested.”</p>

<p>Thor did not answer, but rowed with all his might.</p>

<p>“If you take another stroke,” shouted the student furiously,
levelling his gun, “I’ll shoot both you and your
thievish fox.”</p>

<p>It was meant only for intimidation; but where Mikkel’s
life was at stake, Thor was not easily frightened.</p>

<p>“Shoot away!” he cried, thinking that he was now at
a safe distance, and that the student’s marksmanship was
none of the best. But before he realized what he had
said, whiz! went a bullet over his head. A stiff gale was
blowing, and the little boat was tossed like a foot-ball on
the incoming and the outgoing waves; but the plucky
lad struggled on bravely, until he hove alongside a fishing
schooner, which was to sail the next morning for
Drontheim. Fortunately the skipper needed a deck
hand, and Thor was promptly engaged. The boat which
had helped him to escape was found later and towed
back to shore by a fisherman.</p>

<h3>III.<br /><br /><br />

<span class="fs70">HOW MIKKEL MAKES HIS FORTUNE.</span></h3>

<p>In Drontheim, which is a large commercial city on the
western coast of Norway, Thor soon found occupation as
office-boy in a bank, which did business under the name
of C. P. Lyng &amp; Co. He was a boy of an open, fearless
countenance, and with a frank and winning manner.
Mr. Lyng, at the time when Thor entered his employ,
had just separated from his partner, Mr. Tulstrup, because
the latter had defrauded the firm and several of its
customers. Mr. Lyng had papers in his safe which
proved Mr. Tulstrup’s guilt, but he had contented himself
with dismissing him from the firm, and had allowed
him to take the share of the firm’s property to which he
was legally entitled. The settlement, however, had not
satisfied Mr. Tulstrup, and he had, in order to revenge himself,
gone about to the various customers, whom he had
himself defrauded, and persuaded them to commence suit
against Mr. Lyng, whom he represented as being the
guilty party. He did not, at that time, know that Mr.
Lyng had gained possession of the papers which revealed
the real author of the fraud. On the contrary, he flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>tered
himself that he had destroyed every trace of his
own dishonest transactions.</p>

<p>The fact that Mr. Lyng belonged to a family which
had always been distinguished, in business and social circles,
for its integrity and honor only whetted Tulstrup’s
desire to destroy his good name, and having laid his
plans carefully, he anticipated an easy triumph over honest
Mr. Lyng. His dismay, therefore, was very great
when, after the suit had been commenced in the courts,
he learned that it was his own name and liberty which
were in danger, and not those of his former partner. Mr.
Tulstrup, in spite of the position he had occupied, was
a desperate man, and was capable, under such circumstances,
of resorting to desperate remedies. But, like
most Norwegians, he had a streak of superstition in his
nature, and cherished an absurd belief in signs and omens,
in lucky and unlucky days, and in spectres and apparitions,
foreboding death or disaster. Mr. Tulstrup’s father
had believed in such things, and it had been currently
reported among the peasantry that he had been followed
by a spectral fox, which some asserted to be his wraith,
or double. This fox, it was said, had frequently been
seen during the old man’s lifetime, and when he once saw
it himself, he was frightened nearly out of his wits. Superstitious
stories of this kind are so common in Norway
that one can hardly spend a month in any country district
without hearing dozens of them. The belief in a
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">fylgia</i>, or wraith in the shape of an animal, dates far back
into antiquity, and figures largely in the sagas, or ancient
legends of the Northland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been told that Thor had obtained a position
as office-boy in Mr. Lyng’s bank; and it was more
owing to the boy’s winning appearance than to any fondness
for foxes, on Mr. Lyng’s part, that Mikkel also was
engaged. It was arranged that a cushion whereupon
Mikkel might sleep should be put behind the stove in
the back office. At first Mikkel endured his captivity
here with great fortitude; but he did not like it, and it was
plain that he was pining for the parsonage and his kennel
in the free air, and the pleasant companionship of the
geese and the stupid Achilles. Thor then obtained permission
to have him walk about unchained, and the clerks,
who admired his graceful form and dainty ways, soon
grew very fond of him, and stroked him caressingly, as
he promenaded along the counter or seated himself on
their shoulders, inspecting their accounts with critical
eyes. Thor was very happy to see his friend petted,
though he had an occasional twinge of jealousy when
Mikkel made himself too agreeable to old Mr. Barth, the
cashier, or kissed young Mr. Dreyer, the assistant book-keeper.
Such faithlessness on Mikkel’s part was an ill
return for all the sacrifices Thor had made for him; and
yet, hard as it was, it had to be borne. For an office-boy
cannot afford to have emotions, or, if he has them, cannot
afford the luxury of giving way to them.</p>

<p>C. P. Lyng &amp; Co.’s bank was a solid, old-fashioned
business-house which the clerks entered as boys and
where they remained all their lives. Mr. Barth, the
cashier, had occupied his present desk for twenty-one
years, and had spent nine years more in inferior posi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>tions.
He was now a stout little man of fifty, with close
cropped, highly-respectable side-whiskers and thin gray
hair, which was made to cover his crown by the aid of a
small comb. This comb, which was fixed above his right
ear and held the straggling locks together, was a source
of great amusement to the clerks, who made no end of
witticisms about it. But Mr. Barth troubled himself
very little about their poor puns, and sat serenely poring
over his books and packages of bank-bills from morning
till night. He prided himself above all on his regularity,
and it was said that he had never been one minute too
late or too early during the thirty years he had been in
Mr. Lyng’s bank; accordingly, he had little patience
with the shortcomings of his subordinates, and fined
and punished them in various ways, if they were but a
moment tardy; for the most atrocious of all crimes, in
Mr. Barth’s opinion, was tardiness. The man who suffered
most from his severity was Mr. Dreyer, the assistant
book-keeper. Mr. Dreyer was a good-looking young
man, and very fond of society; and it happened sometimes
that, on the morning after a ball, he would sleep
rather late. He had long rebelled in silence against Mr.
Barth’s tyranny, and when he found that his dissatisfaction
was shared by many of the other clerks, he conceived
a plan to revenge himself on his persecutor. To
this end a conspiracy was formed among the younger
clerks, and it was determined to make Mikkel the agent
of their vengeance.</p>

<p>It was well known by the clerks that Mr. Barth was
superstitious and afraid in the dark; and it was generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
agreed that it would be capital fun to give him a little
fright. Accordingly the following plan was adopted: A
bottle of the oil of phosphorus was procured and Mikkel’s
fur was thoroughly rubbed with it, so that in the dark the
whole animal would be luminous. At five minutes before
five, someone should go down in the cellar and turn
off the gas, just as the cashier was about to enter the
back office to lock up the safe. Then, when the illuminated
Mikkel glared out on him from a dark corner, he
would probably shout or faint or cry out, and then all the
clerks should rush sympathetically to him and render him
every assistance.</p>

<p>Thus the plan was laid, and there was a breathless,
excited stillness in the bank when the hour of five approached.
It had been dark for two hours, and the
clerks sat on their high stools, bending silently over their
desks, scribbling away for dear life. Promptly at seven
minutes before five, up rose Mr. Barth and gave the signal
to have the books closed; then, to the unutterable
astonishment of the conspirators, he handed the key of
the safe to Mr. Dreyer (who knew the combination), and
told him to lock the safe and return the key. At that
very instant, out went the gas; and Mr. Dreyer, although
he was well prepared, could himself hardly master his
fright at Mikkel’s terrible appearance. He struck a
match, lighted a wax taper (which was used for sealing
letters), and tremblingly locked the safe; then, abashed
and discomfited, he advanced to the cashier’s desk and
handed him the key.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would have the kindness, Mr. Dreyer,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
said Mr. Barth, calmly, “to write a letter of complaint
to the gas-company before you go home. It will never
do in the world to have such things happen. I suppose
there must be water in the pipes.”</p>

<p>The old man buttoned his overcoat up to his chin and
marched out; whereupon a shout of laughter burst forth,
in which Mr. Dreyer did not join. He could not see
what they found to laugh at, he said. It took him a
long while to compose his letter of complaint to the gas-company.</p>

<p>Mikkel in the meanwhile was feeling very uncomfortable.
He could not help marvelling at his extraordinary
appearance. He rubbed himself against chairs and tables,
and found to his astonishment that he made everything
luminous that he touched. He had never known any
respectable fox which possessed this accomplishment, and
he felt sure that in some way something was wrong with
him. He could not sleep, but walked restlessly about on
the desks and counters, bristled with anger at the slightest
sound, and was miserable and excited. He could not
tell how far the night had advanced, when he heard a
noise in the back office (which fronted upon the court-yard)
as if a window was being opened. His curiosity
was aroused and he walked sedately across the floor;
then he stopped for a moment to compose himself, for he
was well aware that what he saw was something extraordinary.
A man with a dark-lantern in his hand was
kneeling before the safe with a key in his hand. Mikkel
advanced a little farther and paused in a threatening attitude
on the threshold of the door. With his luminous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
face and body, and a halo of phosphorescent light round
about him, he was terrible to behold. He gave a little
snort, at which the man turned quickly about. But no
sooner had he caught sight of the illuminated Mikkel
than he flung himself on his knees before the little animal,
and with clasped hands and a countenance wild with
fear exclaimed: “Oh, I know who thou art! Pardon
me, pardon me! Thou art my father’s spectral fox! I
know thee, I know thee!”</p>

<p>Mikkel had never suspected that he was anything so
terrible; but, as he saw that the man was bent on mischief,
he did not think it worth while to contradict him.
He only curved his back and bristled, until the man, beside
himself with fear, made a rush for the window and
leaped out into the court-yard. Then Mikkel, thinking
that he had had excitement enough for one night, curled
himself up on his cushion behind the stove and went to
sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, when Mr. Barth arrived, he found
a window in the back office broken, and the door of the
safe wide open. On the floor lay a bundle of papers, all
relating to the transactions of Tulstrup while a member
of the firm, and, moreover, a hat, marked on the inside
with Tulstrup’s name, was found on a chair.</p>

<p>On the same day Mr. Lyng was summoned to the
bedside of his former partner, who made a full confession,
and offered to return through him the money which he
had fraudulently acquired. His leg was broken, and he
seemed otherwise shattered in body and mind. It had
been his purpose, he said, to drive Mr. Lyng from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
firm in disgrace, and he was sure he could have accomplished
it, if Providence itself had not interfered. But,
incredible as it seemed, he had seen a luminous animal
in the bank, and he felt convinced that it was his father’s
spectral fox. It was well enough to smile at such things
and call them childish, but he had certainly seen, he
said, a wonderful, shining fox.</p>

<p>Mr. Lyng did not attempt to convince Mr. Tulstrup
that he was wrong. He took the money and distributed
it among those who had suffered by Mr. Tulstrup’s frauds,
and thus many needy people&mdash;widows and industrious
laborers&mdash;regained their hard-earned property, and all
because Mikkel’s skin was luminous. When Mr. Lyng
heard the whole story from Mr. Dreyer, he laughed
heartily and long. But from that day he took a warm
interest in Thor and his fox, and sent the former to
school and, later, to the university, where he made an
honorable name for himself by his talents and industry.</p>

<p>Poor Mikkel is now almost gray, and his teeth are so
blunt that he has to have his food minced before he can
eat it. But he still occupies a soft rug behind the stove
in the student’s room, and Thor hopes he will live long
enough to be introduced to his master’s wife. For it
would be a pity if she were not to know him to whom
her husband owes his position, and she, accordingly, hers.</p>

<p>I believe it was in the winter of 18&mdash; (but it does not
matter so much about the time) that the servants on the
large estate of Halthorp raised a great ado about something
or other. Whereupon the Baron of Halthorp, who
was too stout to walk down the stairs on slight provocation,
called his steward, in a voice like that of an angry
lion, and asked him, “Why in the name of Moses he did
not keep the rascals quiet.”</p>

<p>“But, your lordship,” stammered the steward, who
was as thin as the baron was stout, “I have kept them
quiet for more than a month past, though it has been
hard enough. Now they refuse to obey me unless I
admit them to your lordship’s presence, that they may
state their complaint.”</p>

<p>“Impudent beggars!” growled the old gentleman.
“Tell them that I am about to take my after-dinner nap,
and that I do not wish to be disturbed.”</p>

<p>“I have told them that a dozen times,” whined the
steward, piteously. “But they are determined to leave
in a body, unless your lordship consents to hear them.”</p>

<p>“Leave! They can’t leave,” cried his honor. “The
law binds them. Well, well, to save talking, fling the
doors open and let them come in.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The steward hobbled away to the great oak-panelled
doors (I forgot to tell you that he limped in his left foot),
and, cautiously turning the knob and the key, peeped
out into the hall. There stood the servants&mdash;twenty-eight
in all&mdash;but, oh! what a sight! They were hollow-cheeked,
with hungry eyes and bloodless lips, and
deep lines about their mouths, as if they had not seen
food for weeks. Their bony hands twitched nervously
at the coarse clothes that flapped in loose folds about
their lean and awkward limbs. They were indeed a pitiful
spectacle. Only a single one of them&mdash;and that was
of course the cook&mdash;looked like an ordinary mortal, or an
extraordinary mortal, if you like, for he was nearly as
broad as he was long. It was owing to the fact that he
walked at the head of the procession, as they filed into
the parlor, that the baron did not immediately discover
the miserable condition of the rest. But when they had
faced about, and stood in a long row from wall to wall&mdash;well,
you would hardly believe it, but the baron, hard-hearted
as he was, came near fainting. There is a limit
to all things, and even a heart of steel would have been
moved at the sight of such melancholy objects.</p>

<p>“Steward,” he roared, when he had sufficiently recovered
himself, “who is the demon who has dared to trifle
with my fair name and honor? Name him, sir&mdash;name
him, and I will strangle him on the spot!”</p>

<p>The steward, even if he had been acquainted with the
demon, would have thought twice before naming him
under such circumstances. Accordingly he was silent.</p>

<p>“Have I not,” continued the baron, still in a voice that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
made his subjects quake&mdash;“have I not caused ample provisions
to be daily distributed among you? Have not
you, Mr. Steward, the keys to my store-houses, and have
you not my authority to see that each member of my
household is properly provided for?”</p>

<p>The steward dared not answer; he only nodded his
head in silence.</p>

<p>“If it please your lordship,” finally began a squeaky
little voice at the end of the row (it was that of the under-groom),
“it isn’t the steward as is to blame, but it’s the
victuals. Somehow there isn’t any taste nor fillin’ to
them. Whether I eat pork and cabbage or porridge with
molasses, it don’t make no difference. It all tastes alike.
As I say, your lordship, the old Nick has got into the
victuals.”</p>

<p>The under-groom had hardly ceased speaking before
the baron, who was a very irascible old gentleman, seized
his large gold-headed cane and as quickly as his bulk
would allow, rushed forward to give vent to his anger.</p>

<p>“I’ll teach you manners, you impudent clown!” he
bawled out, as, with his cane lifted above his head, he
rushed into the ranks of the frightened servants, shouting
to the under-groom, “Criticise my victuals, will you,
you miserable knave!”</p>

<p>The under-groom having on former occasions made the
acquaintance of the baron’s cane, and still remembering
the unpleasant sensation, immediately made for the door,
and slipped nimbly out before a blow had reached him.
All the others, who had to suffer for their spokesman’s
boldness, tumbled pell-mell through the same opening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
jumped, rolled, or vaulted down the steps, and landed in
a confused heap at the bottom of the stairs.</p>

<p>The baron, in the meanwhile, marched with long strides
up and down the floor, and expressed himself, not in the
politest language, concerning the impudence of his domestics.</p>

<p>“However,” he grumbled to himself, “I must look into
this affair and find out what fraud there is at the bottom
of it. The poor creatures couldn’t get as lean as that
unless there was some real trouble.”</p>

<p>About three hours later the baron heard the large bell
over the gable of his store-house ring out for dinner. The
wood-cutters and the men who drove the snow-plough,
and all other laborers on the large estate, as soon as they
heard it, flung away their axes and snow-shovels and
hurried up to the mansion, their beards and hair and eyebrows
all white with hoar-frost, so that they looked like
walking snow-men. But as it happened, the under-groom,
Nils Tagfat, chanced at that moment to be cutting down
a large snow-laden fir-tree which grew on a projecting
knoll of the mountain. He pulled off his mittens and
blew on his hands (for it was bitter cold), and was about
to shoulder his axe, when suddenly he heard a chorus of
queer little metallic voices, as it seemed, right under his
feet. He stopped and listened.</p>

<p>“There is the bell of Halthorp ringing! Where is my
cap? where is my cap?” he heard distinctly uttered,
though he could not exactly place the sound, nor did he
see anybody within a mile around. And just for the
joke of the thing, Nils, who was always a jolly fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
made his voice as fine as he could, and, mimicking the
tiny voices, squeaked out:</p>

<p>“Where is my cap? Where is my cap?”</p>

<p>But imagine his astonishment when suddenly he heard
a voice answer him: “You can take grandfather’s cap!”
and at the same moment there was tossed into his
hands something soft, resembling a small red-peaked
cap. Just out of curiosity, Nils put it on his head to
try how it would fit him, and small as it looked, it fitted
him perfectly. But now, as the cap touched his head,
his eyes were opened to the strangest spectacle he ever
beheld. Out of the mountain came a crowd of gnomes,
all with little red-peaked caps, which made them invisible
to all who were not provided with similar caps.
They hurried down the hill-side toward Halthorp, and
Nils, who was anxious to see what they were about, followed
at a proper distance behind. As he had half expected,
they scrambled up on the railings at the door of
the servants’ dining-hall, and as soon as the door was
opened they rushed in, climbed up on the chairs, and
seated themselves on the backs just as the servants took
their places on the seats. And now Nils, who, you
must remember, had on the cap that made him invisible,
came near splitting his sides with laughter. The first
course was boiled beef and cabbage. The smell was delicious
to Nils’s hungry nostrils, but he had to conquer
his appetite in order to see the end of the game. The
steward stood at the end of the table and served each
with a liberal portion; and at the steward’s side sat the
baron himself, in a large, cushioned easy-chair. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
did not eat, however; he was there merely to see fair
play.</p>

<p>Each servant fell to work greedily with his knife and
fork, and just as he had got a delicious morsel half-way
to his mouth, the gnome on the back of his chair stretched
himself forward and deftly snatched the meat from the
end of the fork. Thus, all the way around the table,
each man unconsciously put his piece of beef into the
wide-open mouth of his particular gnome. And the unbidden
guests grinned shrewdly at one another, and
seemed to think it all capital fun. Sometimes, when
the wooden trays (which were used instead of plates)
were sent to be replenished, they made horrrible grimaces,
often mimicking their poor victims, who chewed and
swallowed and went through all the motions of eating,
without obtaining the slightest nourishment. They all
would have liked to fling knives and forks and trays out
through the windows, but they had the morning’s chastisement
freshly in mind, and they did not dare open
their mouths, except for the futile purpose of eating.</p>

<p>“Well, my lads and lasses,” said the baron, when he
had watched the meal for some minutes; “if you can
complain of food like this, you indeed deserve to be
flogged and put on prison fare.”</p>

<p>“Very likely, your lordship,” said one of the milkmaids;
“but if your lordship would demean yourself
to take a morsel with us, we would bless your lordship
for your kindness and complain no more.”</p>

THE BARON SPRANG UP WITH AN EXCLAMATION OF FRIGHT.</div>
</div>

<p>The baron, looking around at all the hopeless eyes
and haggard faces, felt that there was something besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
vanity that prompted the request; and he accordingly
ordered the cook to bring his own plate and drew his
chair up to the table. Hardly had he seized his knife
when Nils saw a gnome, who had hitherto been seated
on the floor awaiting his turn, crawl up on the arm of
his big chair and, standing on tiptoe, seize between his
teeth the first bit the baron was putting to his mouth.
The old gentleman looked astounded, mystified, bewildered;
but, fearing to make an exhibition of himself,
selected another mouthful, and again conducted it the
accustomed way. The gnome came near laughing right
out, as he despatched this second morsel in the same
manner as the first, and all around the table the little
monsters held their hands over their mouths and seemed
on the point of exploding. The baron put down knife
and fork with a bang; his eyes seemed to be starting out
of his head, and his whole face assumed an expression of
unspeakable horror.</p>

<p>“It is Satan himself who is mocking us!” he cried.
“Send for the priest! Send for the priest!”</p>

<p>Just then Nils crept around behind the baron, who
soon felt something soft, like a fine skull-cap, pressed on
his head, and before he had time to resent the liberty, he
started in terror at the sight of the little creature that he
saw sitting on the arm of his chair. He sprang up with
an exclamation of fright, and pushed the chair back
so violently that it was almost upset upon the floor.
The gnome dexterously leaped down and stood staring
back at the baron for an instant; then, with a spring, he
snatched a potato and half a loaf of bread, and disap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>peared.
In his haste, the baron ran against Nils, the
under-groom, who (now without a cap) was standing with
a smiling countenance calmly surveying all the confusion
about him.</p>

<p>“Now, was I right, your lordship?” he asked, with a
respectful bow. “Did <em>you</em> find the victuals very filling?”</p>

<p>The baron, who was yet too frightened to answer, stood
gazing toward a window-pane, which suddenly and noiselessly
broke, and through which the whole procession of
gnomes, huddled together in flight, tumbled headlong
into the snow-bank without.</p>

<p>“And what shall we do, Nils,” said the baron, the
next day, when he had recovered from his shock, “to
prevent the return of the unbidden guests?”</p>

<p>“Stop ringing the great bell,” answered Nils. “It is
that which invites the gnomes.”</p>

<p>And since that day the dinner-bell has never been rung
at Halthorp.</p>

<p>But one day, late in the winter, Nils the groom, as he
was splitting wood on the mountain-side, heard a plaintively
tinkling voice within, singing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Hunger and sorrow each new day is bringing,</p>
<p class="verse">Since Halthorp bell has ceased its ringing.”</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_BERNT_WENT_WHALING" id="HOW_BERNT_WENT_WHALING"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">HOW BERNT WENT WHALING.</a></h2>


<p>Bernt Holter and his sister Hilda were sitting on
the beach, playing with large spiral cockles which they
imagined were cows and horses. They built stables out
of chips, and fenced in their pastures, and led their cattle
in long rows through the deep grooves they had made in
the sand.</p>

<p>“When I grow up to be a man,” said Bernt, who was
twelve years old, “I am going to sea and catch whales, as
father did when he was young. I don’t want to stand
behind a counter and sell calico and tape and coffee and
sugar,” he continued, thrusting his chest forward, putting
his hands into his pockets, and marching with a manly
swagger across the beach. “I don’t want to play with
cockles, like a baby, any more,” he added, giving a forcible
kick to one of Hilda’s finest shells and sending it flying
across the sand.</p>

<p>“I wish you wouldn’t be so naughty, Bernt,” cried his
sister, with tears in her eyes. “If you don’t want to
play with me, I can play alone. Bernt, oh&mdash;look there!”</p>

<p>Just at that moment a dozen or more columns of water
flew high into the air, and the same number of large,
black tail-fins emerged from the surface of the fiord, and
again slowly vanished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Bernt, in great glee, “it is a school
of dolphins. Good-by, Hilda dear, I think I’ll run down
to the boat-house.”</p>

<p>“I think I’ll go with you, Bernt,” said his sister, obligingly,
rising and shaking the sand from her skirts.</p>

<p>“I think you’ll not,” remarked her brother, angrily;
“I can run faster than you.”</p>

<p>So saying, he rushed away over the crisp sand as fast
as his feet would carry him, while his sister Hilda, who
was rather a soft-hearted girl, and ready with her tears,
ran after him, all out of breath and calling to him at the
top of her voice. Finally, when she was more than half
way to the boat-house, she stumbled against a stone and
fell full length upon the beach. Bernt, fearing that she
might be hurt, paused in his flight and returned to pick
her up, but could not refrain from giving her a vindictive
little shake, as soon as he discovered that she had sustained
no injury.</p>

<p>“I do think girls are the greatest bother that ever was
invented,” he said, in high dudgeon. “I don’t see what
they are good for, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I want to go with you, Bernt,” cried Hilda.</p>

<p>Seeing there was no escape, he thought he might just
as well be kind to her.</p>

<p>“You may go,” he said, “if you will promise never to
tell anybody what I am going to do?”</p>

<p>“No, Bernt, I shall never tell,” said the child, eagerly,
and drying her tears.</p>

<p>“I am going a-whaling,” whispered Bernt, mysteriously.
“Come along!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whaling!” echoed the girl, in delicious excitement.
“Dear Bernt, how good you are! Oh, how
lovely! No, I shall never tell it to anybody as long as
I live.”</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon, and the sun, which at
that time of the year never sets in the northern part of
Norway, threw its red, misty rays like a veil of dull flame
over the lofty mountains which, with their snow-hooded
peaks, pierced the fiery clouds; their huge reflections
shone in soft tints of red, green, and blue in the depth
of the fiord, whose glittering surface was calm and smooth
as a mirror. Only in the bay which the school of dolphins
had entered was the water ruffled; but there, high
spouts rose every moment into the air and descended
again in showers of fine spray.</p>

<p>“It is well that father has gone away with the fishermen,”
said Bernt, as he exerted himself with all his might
to push his small boat down over the slippery beams of
the boat-house. “Here, Hilda, hold my harpoon for
me.”</p>

<p>Hilda, greatly impressed with her own dignity in being
allowed to hold so dangerous a weapon as a harpoon,
grasped it eagerly and held it up in both her arms.
Bernt once more put his shoulder to the prow of his light
skiff (which, in honor of his father’s whaling voyages, he
had named The North Pole) and with a tremendous
effort set it afloat. Then he carefully assisted Hilda into
the boat, in the stern of which she seated herself. Next
he seized the oars and rowed gently out beyond the
rocky headland toward which he had seen the dolphins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
steer their course. He was an excellent sailor for his
years, and could manage a boat noiselessly and well.</p>

<p>“Hilda, take the helm,” he whispered, “or, if you were
only good for anything, you might paddle and we should
be upon them in a minute. Now, remember, and push
the tiller to the side opposite where I want to go.”</p>

<p>“I’ll remember,” she replied, breathlessly.</p>

<p>The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: ‘gentle plashing’">gentle splashing</ins> of the oars and the clicking of the
rowlocks were the only sounds which broke the silence
of the evening. Now and then a solitary gull gave a
long, shrill scream as she dived beneath the surface of
the fiord, and once a fish-hawk’s loud, discordant yell
was flung by the echoes from mountain to mountain.</p>

<p>“Starboard,” commanded Bernt, sternly; but Hilda in
her agitation pushed the tiller to the wrong side and sent
the boat flying to port.</p>

<p>“Starboard, I said!” cried the boy, indignantly; “if I
had known you would be so stupid, I should never have
taken you along.”</p>

<p>“Please, brother dear, do be patient with me,” pleaded
the girl, remorsefully. “I shall not do it again.”</p>

<p>It then pleased his majesty, Bernt Holter, to relent,
although his sister had by her awkwardness alarmed the
dolphins, sending the boat right in their wake, when it
had been his purpose to head them off. He knew well
enough that it takes several minutes for a whole school
of so large a fish as the dolphin to change its course, and
the hunter would thus have a good chance of “pricking”
a laggard before he could catch up with his companions.
Bernt strained every muscle, while coolly keeping his eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
on the water to note the course of his game. His only
chance was in cutting across the bay and lying in wait
for them at the next headland. For he knew very well
that if they were seriously frightened and suspected that
they were being pursued, they could easily beat him by
the speed and dexterity of their movements. But he
saw to his delight that his calculations were correct. Instead
of taking the straight course seaward, the dolphins,
being probably in pursuit of fresh herring, young cod, and
other marine delicacies which they needed for their late
dinner, steered close to land where the young fish are
found in greater abundance, and their following the coastline
of the bay gave Bernt a chance of cutting them
off and making their acquaintance at closer quarters.
Having crossed the little bay, he commanded his sister
to lie down flat in the bottom of the boat&mdash;a command
which she willingly, though with a quaking heart, obeyed.
He backed cautiously into a little nook among the rocks
from which he had a clear passage out, and having one
hand on his harpoon, which was secured by a rope to the
prow of the boat, and the other on the boat-hook (with
which he meant to push himself rapidly out into the
midst of the school), he peered joyously over the gunwale
and heard the loud snorts, followed by the hissing descent
of the spray, approaching nearer and nearer. Now, steady
my boy! Don’t lose your presence of mind! One, two,
three&mdash;there goes! Jumping up, fixing the boat-hook
against the rock, and with a tremendous push shooting
out into the midst of the school was but a moment’s
work. Whew! The water spouts and whirls about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ears as in a shower-bath. Off goes his cap. Let it go!
But stop! What was that? A terrific slap against the
side of the boat as from the tail of a huge fish. Hilda
jumps up with a piercing shriek and the boat careens
heavily to the port side, the gunwale dipping for a
moment under the water. A loud snort, followed again
by a shower of spray, is heard right ahead, and, at the
same moment, the harpoon flies through the air with a
fierce whiz and lodges firmly in a broad, black back.
The huge fish in its first spasm of pain gives a fling with
its tail and for an instant the little boat is lifted out of
the water on the back of the wounded dolphin.</p>

<p>“Keep steady, don’t let go the rope!” shouts Bernt at
the top of his voice, “he won’t hurt&mdash;”</p>

<p>But before he had finished, the light skiff, with a tremendous
splash, struck the water again, and the little
coil of rope to which the harpoon was attached flew humming
over the gunwale and disappeared with astonishing
speed into the deep.</p>

<p>Bernt seized the cord, and when there was little left to
spare, tied it firmly to the prow of the boat, which then,
of course, leaped forward with every effort of the dolphin
to rid itself of the harpoon. The rest of the
school, having taken alarm, had sought deep water, and
were seen, after a few minutes, far out beyond the headland.</p>

<p>“I want to go home, Bernt,” Hilda exclaimed, vehemently.
“I want to go home; I don’t want to get
killed, Bernt.”</p>

<p>“You silly thing! You can’t go home now. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
must just do as I tell you; but, of course&mdash;if you
only are sensible&mdash;you won’t get killed, or hurt at
all.”</p>

<p>While he was yet speaking, the boat began all of a sudden
to move rapidly over the water.</p>

<p>The dolphin had bethought him of flight, not knowing
that, however swiftly he swam, he pulled his enemy after
him. As he rose to the surface, about fifty or sixty yards
ahead, a small column of water shot feebly upward, and
spread in a fan-like, irregular shape before it fell. The
poor beast floundered along for a few seconds, its long,
black body in full view, and then again dived down,
dragging the boat onward with a series of quick convulsive
pulls.</p>

<p>Bernt held on tightly to the cord, while the water
foamed and bubbled about the prow and surged in swirling
eddies in the wake of the skiff.</p>

<p>“If I can only manage to get that dolphin,” said
Bernt, “I know father will give me at least a dollar for
him. There’s lots of blubber on him, and that is used
for oil to burn in lamps.”</p>

<p>The little girl did not answer, but grasped the gunwale
hard on each side, and gazed anxiously at the foaming
and bubbling water. Bernt, too, sat silent in the
prow, but with a fisherman’s excitement in his face. The
sun hung, huge and fiery, over the western mountains, and
sent up a great, dusky glare among the clouds, which
burned in intense but lurid hues of red and gold. Gradually,
and before they were fully aware of it, the boat began
to rise and descend again, and Bernt discovered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the heavy, even roll of the water that they must be near
the ocean.</p>

<p>“Now you may stop, my dear dolphin,” he said, coolly.
“We don’t want you to take us across to America.
Who would have thought that you were such a tough
customer anyway?”</p>

<p>He let go the rope, and, seating himself again, put the
oars into the rowlocks. He tried to arrest the speed of
the boat by vigorous backing; but, to his surprise, found
that his efforts were of no avail.</p>

<p>“Hilda,” he cried, not betraying, however, the anxiety
he was beginning to feel, “take the other pair of oars and
let us see what you are good for.”</p>

<p>Hilda, not realizing the danger, obeyed, a little tremblingly,
perhaps, and put the other pair of oars into their
places.</p>

<p>“Now let us turn the boat around,” sternly commanded
the boy. “It’s getting late, and we must be home before
bedtime. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;pull!”</p>

<p>The oars struck the water simultaneously and the boat
veered half way around; but the instant the oars were
lifted again, it started back into its former course.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you cut the rope and let the dolphin go?”
asked Hilda, striving hard to master the tears, which
again were pressing to her eyelids.</p>

<p>“Not I,” answered her brother; “why, all the fellows
would laugh at me if they heard how I first caught the
dolphin and then the dolphin caught me. No, indeed.
He hasn’t much strength left by this time, and we shall
soon see him float up.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He had hardly uttered these words, when they shot
past a rocky promontory, and the vast ocean spread out
before them. Both sister and brother gave an involuntary
cry of terror. There they were, in their frail little
skiff, far away from home, and with no boat visible for
miles around. “Cut the rope, cut the rope! Dear Bernt,
cut the rope!” screamed Hilda, wringing her hands in
despair.</p>

<p>“I am afraid it is too late,” answered her brother,
doggedly. “The tide is going out, and that is what has
carried us so swiftly to sea. I was a fool that I didn’t
think of it.”</p>

<p>“But what shall we do&mdash;what shall we do!” moaned
the girl, hiding her face in her apron.</p>

<p>“Stop that crying,” demanded her brother, imperiously.
“I’ll tell you what we shall have to do. We
couldn’t manage to pull back against the tide, especially
here at the mouth of the fiord, where the current is so
strong. We had better keep on seaward, and then, if we
are in luck, we shall meet the fishing-boats when they return,
which will be before morning. Anyway, there is
little or no wind, and the night is light enough, so that
they cannot miss seeing us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall surely die, I shall surely die!” sobbed
Hilda, flinging herself down in the bottom of the boat.</p>

<p>Bernt deigned her no answer, but sat gazing sullenly
out over the ocean toward the western horizon, over
which the low sun shed its lurid mist of fire. The
ocean broke with a mighty roar against the rocks,
hushed itself for a few seconds, and then hurled itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
against the rocks anew. To be frank, he was not quite so
fearless as he looked; but he thought it cowardly to give
expression to his fear, and especially in the presence of
his sister, in whose estimation he had always been a hero.
The sun sank lower until it almost touched the water.
The rope hung perfectly slack from the prow, and only
now and then grew tense as if something was feebly tugging
at the other end. He concluded that the dolphin
had bled to death or was exhausted. In the meanwhile,
they were drifting rapidly westward, and the hollow
noise of the breakers was growing more and more
distant. From a merely idle impulse of curiosity Bernt
began to haul in his rope, and presently saw a black body,
some ten or twelve feet long, floating up only a few rods
from the boat. He gave four or five pulls at the rope
and was soon alongside of it. Bernt felt very sad as he
looked at it, and was sorry he had killed the harmless
animal. The thought came into his mind that his present
desperate situation was God’s punishment on him for
his cruel delight in killing.</p>

<p>“But God would not punish my sister for my wickedness,”
he reflected, gazing tenderly at Hilda, who lay in
the boat with her hands folded under her cheek, having
sobbed herself to sleep. He felt consoled, and, murmuring
a prayer he had once heard in church for “sailors in
distress at sea,” lay down at his sister’s side and stared up
into the vast, red dome of the sky above him. The water
plashed gently against the sides of the skiff as it rose and
rocked upon the great smooth “ground swell,” and again
sank down, as it seemed into infinite depths, only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
climb again the next billow. Bernt felt sleepy and hungry,
and the more he stared into the sky the more indistinct
became his vision. He sprang up, determined to
make one last, desperate effort, and strove to row in toward
land, but he could make no headway against the
strong tide, and with aching limbs and a heavy heart he
again stretched himself out in the bottom of the boat.
Before he knew it he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>He did not know how long he had slept, but the dim,
fiery look of the sun had changed into an airy rose color,
when he felt someone seizing him by the arm and crying
out: “In the name of wonders, boy, how did you come
here?”</p>

<p>He rubbed his eyes and saw his father’s shaggy face
close to his.</p>

<p>“And my dear little girl too,” cried the father, in a
voice of terror. “Heaven be praised for having preserved
her!”</p>

<p>And he lifted Hilda in his arms and pressed her close
to his breast. Bernt thought he saw tears glistening in
his eyes. That made him suddenly very solemn. For
he had never seen his father cry before. Around about
him was a fleet of some thirty or forty boats laden to the
gunwale with herring. He now understood his rescue.</p>

<p>“Now tell me, Bernt, truthfully,” said his father,
gravely, still holding the sobbing Hilda tightly in his embrace,
“how did this happen?”</p>

<p>“I went a-whaling,” stammered Bernt, feeling not at
all so brave as he had felt when he started on his voyage.
But he still had courage enough to point feebly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
dead dolphin which lay secured a short distance from the
skiff.</p>

<p>“Wait till we get home,” said his father, “then <em>I’ll</em>
go a-whaling.”</p>

<p>He stood, for a while, gazing in amazement at the
huge fish, then again at his son, as if comparing their
bulk. He felt that he ought to scold the youthful
sportsman, but he knew it was in the blood, and was
therefore more inclined to praise his daring spirit. Accordingly,
when he got home, he did not go a-whaling.</p>

<p>“Bernt,” he said, patting the boy’s curly head, “you
may be a brave lad; but next time your bravery gets the
better of you&mdash;leave the little lass at home.”</p>

<h2><a name="THE_COOPER_AND_THE_WOLVES" id="THE_COOPER_AND_THE_WOLVES"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THE COOPER AND THE WOLVES.</a></h2>


<p>Tollef Kolstad was a cooper, and a very skilful
cooper he was said to be. He had a little son named
Thor, who was as fond of his father as his father was of
him. Whatever Tollef did or said, Thor was sure to
imitate; if Tollef was angry and flung a piece of wood
at the dog who used to come into the shop and bother
him, Thor, thinking it was a manly thing to do, flung
another piece at poor Hector, who ran out whimpering
through the door.</p>

<p>Thor, of course, was not very old before he had a corner
in his father’s shop, where, with a small set of tools which
had been especially bought for him, he used to make
little pails and buckets and barrels, which he sold for
five or ten cents apiece to the boys of the neighborhood.
All the money earned in this way he put into a bank of
tin, made like a drum, of which his mother kept the key.
When he grew up, he thought, he would be a rich man.</p>

<p>The last weeks before Christmas are, in Norway, always
the briskest season in all trades; then the farmer
wants his horses shod, so that he may take his wife and
children to church in his fine, swan-shaped sleigh; he
wants bread and cakes made to last through the holidays,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
so that his servants may be able to amuse themselves,
and his guests may be well entertained when they call;
and, above all, he wants large tubs and barrels, stoutly
made of beech staves, for his beer and mead, with which
he pledges every stranger who, during the festival, happens
to pass his door. You may imagine, then, that at
Christmas time coopers are much in demand, and that it
is not to be wondered at if sometimes they are behind-hand
with their orders. This was unfortunately the case
with Tollef Kolstad at the time when the strange thing
happened which I am about to tell you. He had been
at work since the early dawn, upon a huge tub or barrel,
which had been ordered by Grim Berglund, the richest
peasant in the parish. Grim was to give a large party
on the following day (which was Christmas-Eve), and he
had made Tollef promise to bring the barrel that same
night, so that he might pour the beer into it, and have
all in readiness for the holidays, when it would be wrong
to do any work. It was about ten o’clock at night when
Tollef made the last stroke with his hatchet on the large
hollow thing, upon which every blow resounded as on a
drum. He went to a neighbor and hired from him his
horse and flat sleigh, and was about to start on his errand,
when he heard a tiny voice calling behind him:</p>

<p>“Father, do take me along, too!”</p>

<p>“I can’t, my boy. There may be wolves on the lake,
to-night, and they might like to eat up little boys who
stay out of bed so late.”</p>

<p>“But I am not afraid of them, father. I have my
whip and my hatchet, and I’ll whip them and cut them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Thor here made some threatening flourishes with his
weapons in the air, indicating how he would give it to
the wolves in case they should venture to molest him.</p>

<p>“Well, come along, you little rascal,” said his father,
laughing, and feeling rather proud of his boy’s dauntless
spirit. “You and I are not to be trifled with when we
get mad, are we, Thor?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, father,” said Thor, and clenched his
little mittened fist.</p>

<p>Tollef then lifted him up, wrapped him warmly in
his sheepskin jacket, and put him between his knees,
while he himself seized the reins and urged the horse on.</p>

<p>It was a glorious winter night. The snow sparkled
and shone as if sprinkled with starry diamonds, the
aurora borealis flashed in pale, shifting colors along the
horizon, and the moon sailed calmly through a vast,
dark-blue sea of air. Little Thor shouted with delight
as he saw the broad expanse of glittering ice, which they
were about to cross, stretching out before them like a
polished shield of steel.</p>

<p>“Oh, father, I wish we had taken our skates along,
and pulled your barrel across on a sled,” cried the boy,
ecstatically.</p>

<p>“That I might have done, if I had had a sled large
enough for the barrel,” replied the father. “But then
we should have been obliged to pull it up the hills on
the other side.”</p>

<p>The sleigh now struck the ice and shot forward, swinging
from side to side, as the horse pulled a little unevenly.
Whew! how the cold air cut in their faces. How it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
whizzed and howled in the tree-tops! Hark! What
was that? Tollef instinctively pressed his boy more
closely to him. Hush!&mdash;his heart stood still, while that
of the boy, who merely felt the reflex shock of his father’s
agitation, hammered away the more rapidly. A terrible,
long-drawn howl, as from a chorus of wild, far-away
voices, came floating away over the crowns of the pine-trees.</p>

<p>“What was that, father,” asked Thor, a little tremulously.</p>

<p>“It was wolves, my child,” said Tollef, calmly.</p>

<p>“Are you afraid, father?” asked the boy again.</p>

<p>“No, child, I am not afraid of one wolf, nor of ten
wolves; but if they are in a flock of twenty or thirty,
they are dangerous. And if they scent our track, as
probably they will, they will be on us in five minutes.”</p>

<p>“How will they scent our track, father?”</p>

<p>“They smell us in the wind; and the wind is from us
and to them, and then they howl to notify their comrades,
so that they may attack us in sufficient force.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t we return home, then?” inquired the
boy, still with a tolerably steady voice, but with sinking
courage.</p>

<p>“They are behind us. Our only chance is to reach
the shore before they overtake us.”</p>

<p>The horse, sniffing the presence of wild beasts, snorted
wildly as it ran, but, electrified as it were, with the sense
of danger, strained every nerve in its efforts to reach the
farther shore. The howls now came nearer and nearer,
and they rose with a frightful distinctness in the clear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
wintry air, and resounded again from the border of the
forest.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you throw away the barrel, father?” said
Thor, who, for his father’s sake, strove hard to keep
brave. “Then the sleigh will run so much the faster.”</p>

<p>“If we are overtaken, our safety is in the barrel. Fortunately,
it is large enough for two, and it has no ears and
will fit close to the ice.”</p>

<p>Tollef was still calm; but, with his one disengaged
arm, hugged his little son convulsively.</p>

<p>“Now, keep brave, my boy,” he whispered in his ear.
“They will soon be upon us. Give me your whip.”</p>

<p>It just occurred to Tollef that he had heard that wolves
were very suspicious, and that men had often escaped
them by dragging some small object on the ground behind
them. He, therefore, broke a chip from one of the
hoops of the barrel, and tied it to the lash of the whip;
just then he heard a short, hungry bark behind him, and,
turning his head, saw a pack of wolves, numbering more
than a dozen, the foremost of which was within a few
yards of the sleigh. He saw the red, frothy tongue hanging
out of its mouth, and he smelt that penetrating, wild
smell with which everyone is familiar who has met a wild
beast in its native haunts. While encouraging the reeking,
foam-flecked horse, Tollef, who had only half faith
in the experiment with the whip, watched anxiously the
leader of the wolves, and observed to his astonishment
that it seemed to be getting no nearer. One moment it
seemed to be gaining upon them, but invariably, as soon
as it reached the little chip which was dragging along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
ice, this suddenly arrested its attention and immediately
its speed slackened. The cooper’s hope began to revive,
and he thought that perhaps there was yet a possibility
that they might see the morrow’s sun. But his courage
again began to ebb when he discovered in the distance a
second pack of wolves, larger than the first, and which,
with terrific speed, came running, leaping, and whirling
toward them from another direction. And while this
terrible discovery was breaking through his almost callous
sense, he forgot, for an instant, the whip, the lash
of which swung under the runners of the sleigh and
snapped. The horse, too, was showing signs of exhaustion,
and Tollef, seeing that only one chance was left,
rose up with his boy in his arms, and upsetting the barrel
on the ice, concealed himself and the child under it.
Hardly had he had time to brace himself against its
sides, pressing his feet against one side and his back
against the other, when he heard the horse giving a wild
scream, while the short, whining bark of the wolves told
him that the poor beast was selling its life dearly. Then
there was a desperate scratching and scraping of horseshoes,
and all of a sudden the sound of galloping hoof-beats
on the ice, growing fainter and fainter. The horse
had evidently succeeded in breaking away from the sleigh,
and was testing his speed in a race for life. Some of the
wolves were apparently pursuing him, while the greater
number remained to investigate the contents of the barrel.
The howling and barking of these furious creatures
without was now incessant. Within the barrel it was
dark as pitch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, keep steady!” said Tollef, feeling a sudden
shock, as if a wolf had leaped against their improvised
house with a view to upsetting it. He felt himself and
the boy gliding a foot or two over the smooth ice, but
there was no further result from the attack. A minute
passed: again there came a shock, and a stronger one
than the first. A long, terrible howl followed this second
failure. The little boy, clutching his small cooper’s
hatchet in one hand, sat pale but determined in the dark,
while with the other he clung to his father’s arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” he cried, in terror, “I feel something
on my back.”</p>

<p>The father quickly struck a light, for he fortunately
had a supply of matches in his pocket, and saw a wolf’s
paw wedged in between the ice and the rim of the barrel;
and in the same instant he tore the hatchet from his son’s
hand and buried its edge in the ice. Then he handed
the amputated paw to Thor, and said:</p>

<p>“Put that into your wallet, and the sheriff will pay
you a reward for it.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> For a wolf without paws couldn’t
do much harm.”</p>

<p>While he was yet speaking, a third assault upon the
barrel lifted one side of it from the ice, and almost overturned
it. Instead of pushing against the part nearest
the ice, a wolf, more cunning than the rest, had leaped
against the upturned bottom.</p>

<p>You can imagine what a terrible night father and son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
spent together in this constant struggle with the voracious
beasts, that never grew weary of attacking their
hiding-place. The father was less warmly clad than the
son, and, moreover, was obliged to sit on the ice, while
Thor could stand erect without knocking against the
bottom of the barrel; and if it had not been for the excitement
of the situation, which made Tollef’s blood
course with unwonted rapidity, it is more than probable
that the intense cold would have made him drowsy, and
thus lessened his power of resistance. The warmth of
his body had made a slight cavity where he was sitting,
and whenever he remained a moment still, his trousers
froze fast to the ice. It was only the presence of his
boy that inspired him with fresh courage, whenever hope
seemed about to desert him.</p>

<p>About an hour after the flight of the horse, when five
or six wolves’ paws had been cut off in the same manner
as the first, there was a lull in the attack, but a
sudden increase of the howling, whining, yelping, and
barking noise without. Tollef concluded that the
wolves, maddened by the smell of blood, were attacking
their wounded fellows; and as their howls
seemed to come from a short distance, he cautiously
lifted one side of the barrel and peered forth; but in
the same instant a snarling bark rang right in his ear,
and two paws were thrust into the opening. Then
came a howl of pain, and another paw was put into
Thor’s wallet.</p>

<p>But hark! What is that? It sounds like a song, or
rather like a hymn. The strain comes nearer and nearer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
resounding from mountain to mountain, floating peacefully
through the pure and still air:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Who knows how near I am mine ending;</p>
<p class="verse">So quickly time doth pass away.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Tollef, in whose breast hope again was reviving, put
his ear to the ice, and heard distinctly the tread of
horses and of many human feet. He listened for a minute
or more, but could not discover whether the sound
was coming any nearer. It occurred to him that in all
probability the people, being unarmed, would have no
desire to cope with a large pack of wolves, especially as
to them there could be no object in it. If they saw the
barrel, how could they know that there was anybody
under it? He comprehended instantly that his only
chance of life was in joining those people before they
were too far away. And, quickly resolved, he lifted the
boy on his left arm, and grasped the hatchet in his disengaged
hand. Then, with a violent thrust, he flung the
barrel from over him, and ran in the direction of the
sound. The wolves, as he had inferred, were lacerating
their bleeding comrades; but the moment they saw him,
a pack of about a dozen immediately started in pursuit.
They leaped up against him on all sides, while he struck
furiously about him with his small weapon. Fortunately,
he had sharp steel pegs on his boots, and kept his footing
well; otherwise the combat would have been a short
one. His voice, too, was powerful, and his shouts rose
high above the howling of the beasts. He soon perceived
that he had been observed, and he saw in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
bright moonlight six or eight men running toward him.
Just then, as perhaps in his joy his vigilance was for a
fraction of a second relaxed, he felt a pull in the fleshy
part of his right arm. He was not conscious of any
sharp pain, and was astonished to see the blood flowing
from an ugly wound. But he only held his boy the
more tightly, while he fought and ran with the strength
of despair.</p>

<p>Now the men were near. He could hear their voices.
But his brain was dizzy, and he saw but dimly.</p>

<p>“Hello, friend; don’t crack my skull for my pains!”
someone was shouting close to his ear, and he let his
hatchet fall, and he fell himself, too, prostrate on the
ice.</p>

<p>The wolves, at the sight of the men, had retired to a
safe distance, from which they watched the proceedings,
as if uncertain whether to return.</p>

<p>As soon as Tollef had recovered somewhat from his
exhaustion and his loss of blood, he and his boy were
placed upon a sleigh, and his wound was carefully bandaged.
He now learned that his rescuers were on their
way to a funeral, which was to take place on the next
day, but, on account of the distance to the church, they
had been obliged to start during the night. Hence their
solemn mood, and their singing of funeral hymns.</p>

<p>After an hour’s ride they reached the cooper’s cottage,
and were invited to rest and to share such hospitality as
the house could afford. But when they were gone,
Tollef clasped his sleeping boy in his arms and said to
his wife: “If it had not been for him, you might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
had no husband to-day. It was his little whip and toy
hatchet that saved our lives.”</p>

<p>Eleven wolves’ paws were found in Thor’s wallet, and,
on Christmas eve, he went to the sheriff with them and
received a reward which nearly burst his old savings-bank,
and compelled his mother to buy a new one.</p>

<h2><a name="MAGNIES_DANGEROUS_RIDE" id="MAGNIES_DANGEROUS_RIDE"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">MAGNIE’S DANGEROUS RIDE</a></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Magnie was consumed with the hunting fever. He
had been away to school since he was ten years old, and
had never had the chance of doing anything remarkable.
While his brother, Olaf, who was a midshipman in the
navy, roamed about the world, and had delightful adventures
with Turks and Arabs, and all sorts of outlandish
people, Magnie had to scan Virgil and Horace and torment
his soul with algebraic problems. It was not at all
the kind of life he had sketched out for himself, and if it
had not been his father who had imposed it upon him,
he would have broken away from all restraints and gone
to Turkey or China, or some place where exciting things
happened. In the meanwhile, as he lacked money for
such an enterprise, he would content himself with whatever
excitement there was in hunting, and as his brothers,
Olaf and little Edwin (who was fourteen years old),
were also at home for the vacation, there was a prospect
of many delightful expeditions by sea and by land.
Moreover, their old friend Grim Hering-Luck, who was
their father’s right-hand man, had promised to be at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
disposal and put them on the track of exciting experiences.
They had got each a gun, and had practised
shooting at a target daily since their return from the city.
Magnie, or Magnus Birk, as his real name was, had once
(though Olaf stoutly maintained that it was mere chance)
hit the bull’s-eye at a hundred yards, and he was now
eager to show his skill on something more valuable than
a painted target. It was, therefore, decided that Grim
and the boys should go reindeer-hunting. They were to
be accompanied by the professional hunter, Bjarne Sheepskin.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning. The rays of the sun shot
from the glacier peaks in long radiant shafts down into
the valley. The calm mirror of the fiord glittered in the
light and fairly dazzled the eye, and the sea-birds drifted
in noisy companies about the jutting crags, plunged
headlong into the sea, and scattered the spray high into
the air. The blue smoke rose perpendicularly from the
chimneys of the fishermen’s cottages along the beach, and
the housewives, still drowsy with sleep, came out, rubbed
their eyes and looked toward the sun to judge of the
hour. One boat after another was pushed out upon the
water, and the ripples in their wakes spread in long diverging
lines toward either shore. The fish leaped in
the sun, heedless of the gulls which sailed in wide circles
under the sky, keeping a sharp lookout for the movements
of the finny tribe. The three boys could only
stand and gaze in dumb astonishment upon the splendid
sights which the combined heavens, earth, and sea afforded.
Their father, who was much pleased with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
determination and enterprise, had readily given his consent
to the reindeer hunt, on condition that Grim should
take command and be responsible for their safety. They
were now mounted upon three sturdy ponies, while their
provisions, guns, and other commodities were packed
upon a fourth beast&mdash;a shaggy little monster named
Bruno, who looked more like a hornless goat than a
horse. Bjarne Sheepskin, a long, round-shouldered fellow,
with a pair of small, lively eyes, was leading this
heavily laden Bruno by the bridle, and the little caravan,
being once set in motion, climbed the steep slopes toward
the mountains with much persistence and dexterity.
The ponies, which had been especially trained for mountain
climbing, planted their hoofs upon the slippery rocks
with a precision which was wonderful to behold, jumped
from stone to stone, slipped, scrambled up and down, but
never fell. As they entered the pine forest, where the
huge trunks grew in long, dark colonnades, letting in
here and there stray patches of sunshine, partridges and
ptarmigan often started under the very noses of the
horses, and Magnie clamored loudly for his gun, and
grew quite angry with Bjarne, who would allow “no fooling
with tomtits and chipmunks, when they were in
search of big game.” Even hares were permitted to go
unmolested; and it was not until a fine capercailzie<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
cock tumbled out of the underbrush close to the path, that
Bjarne flung his gun to his cheek and fired. The capercailzie
made a somersault in the air, and the feathers flew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
about it as it fell. Bjarne picked it up quietly, tied its legs
together, and hung it on the pommel of Edwin’s saddle.
“That will make a dinner for gentlefolks,” he said,
“if the dairy-maids up on the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">saeters</i> should happen to
have nothing in the larder.”</p>

<p>Gradually, as they mounted higher, the trees became
more stunted in their growth, and the whole character of
the vegetation changed. The low dwarf-birch stretched
its long, twisted branches along the earth, the silvery-white
reindeer-moss clothed in patches the barren ground,
and a few shivering alpine plants lifted their pale, pink
flowers out of the general desolation. As they reached
the ridge of the lower mountain range the boys saw before
them a scene the magnificence of which nearly took
their breath away. Before them lay a wide mountain
plain, in the bottom of which two connected lakes lay
coldly glittering. Round about, the plain was settled
with rude little log-houses, the so-called <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">saeters</i>, or mountain
dairies, where the Norse peasants spend their brief
summers, pasturing their cattle.</p>

<p>They started at a lively trot down the slope toward
this highland plain, intending to reach the Hasselrud
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">saeter</i>, where they expected to spend the night; for it
was already several hours past noon, and there could be
no thought of hunting reindeer so late in the day. Judging
by appearances, the boys concluded that fifteen or
twenty minutes would bring them to the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">saeter</i>; but
they rode on for nearly two hours, and always the cottages
seemed to recede, and the distance showed no signs
of diminishing. They did not know how deceptive all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
distances are in this wondrously clear mountain air, whose
bright transparency is undimmed by the dust and exhalations
of the lower regions of the earth. They would
scarcely have believed that those huge glacier peaks,
which seemed to be looming up above their very heads,
were some eight to twelve miles away, and that the
eagle which soared above them was far beyond the range
of their rifles.</p>

<p>It was about five o’clock when they rode in upon the
<i lang="no" xml:lang="no">saeter</i> green, where the dairy-maids were alternately
blowing their horns and yodelling. Their long flaxen
braids hung down their backs, and their tight-fitting
scarlet bodices and white sleeves gave them a picturesque
appearance. The cattle were lowing against the sky,
answering the call of the horn. The bells of cows, goats,
and sheep were jangled in harmonious confusion; and
the noise of the bellowing bulls, the bleating sheep, and
the neighing horses was heard from all sides over the
wide plain.</p>

<p>The three brothers were received with great cordiality
by the maids, and they spent the evening, after the supper
was finished, in listening to marvellous stories about
the ogres who inhabited the mountains, and the hunting
adventures with which Bjarne Sheepskin’s life had been
crowded, and which he related with a sportsman’s usual
exaggerations. The beds in one of the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">saeter</i> cottages
were given up to the boys, and they slept peacefully until
about four o’clock in the morning, when Grim aroused
them and told them that everything was ready for their
departure. They swallowed their breakfast hastily, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
started in excited silence across the plateau. Edwin and
the horses they left behind in charge of the dairy-maids,
but took with them an old staghound who had some
good blood in him, and a finer scent than his sedate behavior
and the shape of his nose would have led one to
suppose.</p>

<p>Light clouds hovered under the sky; the mist lay like
a white sheet over the mountain, and drifted in patches
across the plain. Bjarne and Grim were carrying the guns,
while Olaf led the hound, and Magnus trotted briskly
along, stopping every now and then to examine every
unfamiliar object that came in his way. The wind blew
toward them, so that there was no chance that their
scent could betray them, in case there were herds of deer
toward the north at the base of the glaciers. They had
not walked very far, when Bjarne put his hand to his lips
and stooped down to examine the ground. The dog lifted
his nose and began to snuff the air, wag his tail, and
whine impatiently.</p>

<p>“Hush, Yutul,” whispered Bjarne; “down! down,
and keep still!”</p>

<p>The dog crouched down obediently and held his
peace.</p>

<p>“Here is a fresh track,” the hunter went on, pointing
to a hardly perceptible depression in the moss. “There
has been a large herd here&mdash;one buck and at least a dozen
cows. Look, here is a stalk that has just been bitten off,
and the juice is not dry yet.”</p>

<p>“How long do you think it will be before we shall
meet them?” asked Magnus, breathlessly. The hunting-fever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
was throbbing in his veins, and he crawled cautiously
among the bowlders with his rifle cocked.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t tell; may be an hour, may be three. Hand
me your field-glass, Lieutenant, and I will see if I can
catch sight of ’em. A gray beast ain’t easily seen agin
the gray stone. It was fer the same reason I wanted
ye to wear gray clothes; we don’t want to give the
game any advantage, fer the sentinels be allers on the
lookout fer the herd, and at the least bit of unfamiliar
color, they give their warnin’ snort, and off starts the
flock, scudding away like a drift of mist before the
wind.”</p>

<p>Crouching down among the lichen-clad rocks, all listened
in eager expectation.</p>

<p>“Down!” whispered Bjarne, “and cock rifles! A
pair of antlers agin the snow! Hallo! it is as I thought&mdash;a
big herd. One, two, three&mdash;five&mdash;seven&mdash;ten&mdash;fourteen!
One stunnin’ buck, worth his forty dollars at least.
Now follow me slowly. Look out for your guns! You,
Grim, keep the dog muzzled.”</p>

<p>The boys strained their eyes above the edge of the
stones, but could see nothing. Their hearts hammered
against their sides, and the blood throbbed in their temples.
As far as their eyes could reach they saw only the
gray waste of bowlders, interrupted here and there by
patches of snow or a white glacier-stream, which plunged
wildly over a precipice, while a hovering moke indicated
its further progress through the plain. Nevertheless, trusting
the experience of their leader, they made no remark,
but crept after him, choosing like him every available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
stone for cover. After half an hour of this laborious exercise,
Bjarne suddenly stretched himself flat upon the
ground, and the others, though seeing no occasion for
such a manœuvre, promptly followed his example. But
the next moment enlightened them. Looming up against
the white snow, some sixty or a hundred feet from them,
they saw a magnificent pair of antlers, and presently the
whole body of a proud animal was distinctly visible
against the glacier. In the ravine below a dozen or more
cows with their calves were nibbling the moss between
the stones, but with great deliberateness, lifting their
heads every minute and snuffing the air suspiciously;
they presently climbed up on the hard snow and began a
frolic, the like of which the boys had never seen before.
The great buck raised himself on his hind-legs, shook
his head, and made a leap, kicking the snow about him
with great vehemence. Several of the cows took this as
an invitation for a general jollification, and they began to
frisk about, kicking their heels against the sky and shaking
their heads, not with the wanton grace of their chief,
but with half-pathetic attempts at imitation. This,
Magnus thought, was evidently a reindeer ball; and
very sensible they were to have it early in the morning,
when they felt gay and frisky, rather than in the night,
when they ought to be asleep. What troubled him, however,
was that Bjarne did not shoot; he himself did not
venture to send a bullet into the big buck, although it
seemed to him he had an excellent aim. The slightest
turn in the wind would inevitably betray them, and then
they would have had all their toil for nothing. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
would have liked to suggest this to Bjarne; but in order
to do this, he would have to overtake him, and Bjarne
was still wriggling himself cautiously forward among the
stones, pushing himself on with his elbows, as a seal does
with his flippers. In his eagerness to impart his counsel
to Bjarne, Magnus began to move more rapidly; raising
himself on his knees he quite inadvertently showed his
curly head above a bowlder. The buck lifted his superb
head with a snort, and with incredible speed the whole
herd galloped away; but in the same moment two bullets
whistled after them, and the buck fell flat upon the
snow. The cow which had stood nearest to him reared
on her hind-legs, made a great leap, and plunged headlong
down among the stones. With a wild war-whoop,
the boys jumped up, and Magnus, who had come near
ruining the whole sport, seized, in order to make up for
his mishap, a long hunting-knife and rushed forward to
give the buck the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-grace</i>,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> in accordance with the
rules of the chase. Bounding forward with reckless disregard
of all obstacles, he was the first down on the snow.
In one instant he was astride of the animal, and had just
raised his knife, when up leaped the buck and tore away
along the edge of the snow like a gust of wind. The long-range
shot, hitting him in the head, had only stunned him,
but had not penetrated the skull. And, what was worse,
in his bewilderment at the unexpected manœuvre, Magnus
dropped his knife, seizing instinctively the horns of
the reindeer to keep from falling. Away they went with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
a terrific dizzying speed. The frightened boy clung convulsively
to the great antlers; if he should fall off, his
head would be crushed against the bowlders. The cold
glacier-wind whistled in his ears, and stung his face like
a multitude of tiny needles. He had to turn his head in
order to catch his breath; and he strained his eyes to
see if anything was being done by his companions for
his rescue. But he could see nothing except a great expanse
of gray and white lines, which ran into each other
and climbed and undulated toward him and sloped away,
but seemed associated with no tangible object. He
thought, for a moment, that he saw Grim Hering-Luck
aiming his gun, but he seemed to be up in the sky, and
to be growing huger and huger until he looked more
like a fantastic cloud than a man. The thought suddenly
struck him that he might be fainting, and it sent
a thrill of horror through him. With a vehement effort
he mastered his fear and resolved that, whatever happened,
he would not give way to weakness. If he was to
lose his life, he would, at all events, make a hard fight
for it; it was, on the whole, quite a valuable life, he concluded,
and he did not mean to sell it cheaply.</p>

<p>Troubling himself little about the direction his steed
was taking, he shut his eyes, and began to meditate upon
his chances of escape; and after some minutes, he was
forced to admit that they seemed very slim. When the
buck should have exhausted his strength, as in the
course of time he must, he would leave his rider somewhere
in this vast trackless wilderness, where the biting
wind swept down from the eternal peaks of ice, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
wolves roamed about in great hungry companies, and
where, beside them, the reindeer and the ptarmigan were
the only living things amid the universal desolation.
When he opened his eyes again, Magnus discovered that
the buck had overtaken the fleeing herd, which, however,
were tearing away madly at his approach, being evidently
frightened at the sight and the scent of the unfamiliar
rider. The animal was still galloping on, though
with a less dizzying rapidity, and Magnus could distinguish
the general outline of the objects which seemed to
be rushing against him, as if running a race in the opposite
direction. The herd were evidently betaking themselves
into the upper glacier region, where no foot less
light and swift than theirs could find safety among the
terrible ravines and crevasses.</p>

<p>Fully an hour had passed, possibly two, and it seemed
vain to attempt to measure the distance which he had
passed over in this time. At all events, the region did
not present one familiar object, and of Olaf and his companions
Magnie saw no trace. The only question was,
what chance had they of finding him, if they undertook
to search for him, as, of course, they would. If he could
only leave some sign or mark by which they might know
the direction he had taken, their search might perhaps
be rewarded with success. He put one hand in his
pocket, but could find nothing that he could spare except
a red silk handkerchief. That had the advantage
of being bright, and would be sure to attract attention.
The dog would be likely to detect it or to catch the
scent of it. But he must have something heavy to tie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
up in the handkerchief, or it might blow “all over creation.”
The only thing he could find was a silver matchbox
which he had obtained by a trade with Olaf, and
which bore the latter’s initials. He carefully emptied it,
and put the matches (which he foresaw might prove useful)
in his vest-pocket; then tied up the box securely
and dropped it, with the handkerchief, upon a conspicuous
rock, where its bright color might appear striking
and unnatural. He was just on the ridge of what
proved to be a second and higher mountain plateau, the
wild grandeur of which far transcended that of the first.
Before him lay a large sheet of water of a cool green tint,
and so clear that the bottom was visible as far as the
eye could reach. A river had made its way from the
end of this lake and plunged, in a series of short cataracts,
down the slope to the lower plain.</p>

<p>It made Magnus shiver with dread to look at this
coldly glittering surface, and what was his horror when
suddenly his reindeer, in his pursuit of the herd, which
were already in the water, rushed in, and began, with
loud snorts, to swim across to the farther shore! This
was an unforeseen stratagem which extinguished his last
hope of rescue; for how could Bjarne track him through
the water, and what means would he find of crossing, in
case he should guess that the herd had played this dangerous
trick on him? He began to dread also that the
endurance of the buck would be exhausted before he
reached dry land again, and that they might both perish
miserably in the lake. In this horrible distress nothing
occurred to him except to whisper the Lord’s Prayer; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
as his terror increased, his voice grew louder and louder,
until he fairly shouted the words, “And deliver us from
evil,” and the echoes from the vast solitudes repeated,
first clearly and loudly, then with fainter and fainter
accents: “And deliver us from evil&mdash;and deliver us
from evil.” His despairing voice rang strangely under
the great empty sky, and rumbled among the glaciers,
which flung it back and forth until it died away in the
blue distance. It was as if the vast silent wilderness,
startled at the sound of a human voice, were wonderingly
repeating the strange and solemn words.</p>

<p>A vague sense of security stole over him when he had
finished his prayer. But the chill of the icy water had
nearly benumbed his limbs, and he feared that the loss
of heat would conquer his will, and make him unconscious
before the buck should reach the shore. He felt
distinctly his strength ebbing away, and he knew of
nothing that he could do to save himself. Then suddenly
a daring thought flashed through his brain. With
slow and cautious movements he drew his legs out of
the water, and, standing for a moment erect on the
buck’s back, he crawled along his neck and climbed up
on the great antlers, steadying himself carefully and
clinging with all his might. His only fear was that the
animal would shake him off and send him headlong into
the icy bath from which he was endeavoring to escape.
But, after two futile efforts, during which the boy had
held on only by desperate exertion, the buck would
probably have resigned himself to his fate, if he had not
been in imminent danger of drowning. Magnus was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
therefore, much against his will, forced to dip his limbs
into the chilly water, and resume his former position.
It was a strange spectacle, to see all the horned heads
round about sticking out of the water, and Magnus,
though he had always had a thirst for adventures, had
never expected <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: ‘to find himself himself in’">to find himself in</ins> such an incredible
situation. Fortunately, they were now approaching
the shore, and whatever comfort there was in having
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i> under his feet would not be wanting to him.
The last minutes were indeed terribly long, and again
and again the buck, overcome with fatigue, dipped his
nose under the water, only to raise it again with a snort,
and shake his head as if impatient to rid himself of his
burden. But the boy, with a spark of reviving hope,
clung only the more tenaciously to the antlers, and remained
unmoved.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;and it seemed a small eternity since he had
left his brother and companions&mdash;Magnus saw the herd
scramble up on the stony beach. The buck he rode
was soon among the foremost, and, having reached the
land, shook his great body and snorted violently.</p>

<p>“Now’s my chance,” thought Magnus; “now I can
slide off into the snow before he takes to his heels
again.”</p>

<p>But, odd as it may seem, he had a reluctance to part
company with the only living creature (except the
wolves) that inhabited this awful desert. There was a
vague chance of keeping from freezing to death as long
as he clung to the large, warm animal; while, seated
alone upon this bleak shore, with his clothes wringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
wet, and the cold breath of the glacier sweeping down
upon him, he would die slowly and miserably with hunger
and cold. He was just contemplating this prospect,
seeing himself in spirit lying dead upon the shore of the
lake, and picturing to himself the grief of his brother
and father, when suddenly his glance was arrested by
what seemed a faint column of smoke rising from among
the bowlders. The herd of reindeer had evidently made
the same discovery, for they paused, in a startled manner,
and wheeled about toward the easterly shore, past
which a branch of the glacier was pushing downward
into the lower fiord-valley.</p>

<p>Magnie, who had by this time made up his mind not
to give up his present place except for a better one,
strained his eye in the opposite direction, to make sure
that he was not deceived; and having satisfied himself
that what he saw was really smoke, he determined to
leap from his seat at the very first opportunity. But as
yet the speed of the buck made such a venture unsafe.
With every step, however, the territory was becoming
more irregular, and made the progress even of a reindeer
difficult.</p>

<p>Magnus drew up his feet, and was about to slide off,
having planned to drop with as slight a shock as possible
upon a flat moss-grown rock, when, to his utter amazement,
he saw a human figure standing at the edge of the
glacier, and aiming a rifle, as it appeared, straight at his
head. He tried to scream, but terror choked his voice.
He could not bring forth a sound. And before even the
thought had taken shape in his bewildered brain he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
a flash, and heard the report of a shot which rumbled
away with tremendous reverberations among the glaciers.
There was a surging sound in his ears, and strange lights
danced before his eyes. He thought he must be dead.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Magnie never knew how long he was unconscious.
The first thing he remembered was a delicious sense of
warmth and comfort stealing through him, and strange,
unintelligible sounds buzzing in the air about him.
Somebody was talking kindly to him, and a large, warm
hand was gliding over his forehead and cheeks. The
peace and warmth were grateful to him after the intense
strain of his dangerous ride. He was even loth to open
his eyes when his reviving memory began to make the
situation clear to him.</p>

<p>“It was a reckless shot, Harry,” he heard someone
say in a foreign tongue, which he soon recognized as
English, “even if it did turn out well. Suppose you
had sent your bullet crashing through the young fellow
instead of the buck. How would you have felt then?”</p>

<p>“I should have felt very badly, I am sure,” answered
a younger voice, which obviously belonged to Magnie’s
rescuer; “but I followed my usual way of doing things.
If I didn’t act that way, I shouldn’t act at all. And you
will admit, Uncle, it is a queer sort of thing to see a fellow
come riding on a reindeer buck, in the midst of a
wild herd, and in a trackless wilderness like this, where
nobody but wolves or geologists would be apt to dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>cover
any attractions. Now, I saw by the young man’s
respectable appearance that he couldn’t be a geologist; and
if he was a wolf, I didn’t mind much if I did shoot him.”</p>

<p>At this point Magnie opened his eyes and stared wonderingly
about him. He found himself in a small,
cramped room, the walls of which were draped with canvas,
and scarcely high enough under the ceiling to allow
a man to stand erect. Against the walls a number of
shining brass instruments were leaning, and in a corner
there was a hearth, the smoke of which escaped through
a hole in the roof. Two bunks filled with moss, with a
sheet and a blanket thrown over each, completed the
outfit of the primitive dwelling. But Magnie was more
interested in the people than in the looks of the room.
A large, blond, middle-aged man, inclined to stoutness,
was holding Magnie’s hand as if counting his pulse-beat,
and a very good-looking young fellow, of about his own
age, was standing at the hearth, turning a spit upon
which was a venison steak.</p>

<p>“Hallo! Our young friend is returning from the land
of Nod,” said the youth who had been addressed as
Harry. “I am glad you didn’t start on a longer journey,
young chap, when I fired at you; for if you had you
would have interfered seriously with my comfort.”</p>

<p>Magnie, who was a fair English scholar, understood
perfectly what was said to him, but several minutes
elapsed before he could collect himself sufficiently to answer.
In order to gain time, he made an effort to raise,
himself and take a closer look at his surroundings, but
was forced by the older man to abandon the attempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not so fast, my dear, not so fast;” he said, stooping
over him, and gently pushing him back into a reclining
position. “You must remember that you have a big
lump on your head from your fall, and it won’t do to be
frisky just yet. But before conversing further, it might
be well to ascertain whether we understand each other.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think&mdash;I think&mdash;I do,” stammered Magnie.
“I know some English.”</p>

<p>“Ah, then we shall get along charmingly,” the man remarked,
with an encouraging smile. “And I think
Harry’s venison steak is done by this time; and dinner,
as you know, affords the most delightful opportunity for
getting acquainted. Gunnar, our guide, who is outside
skinning your reindeer buck, will soon present himself
and serve the dinner. Here he is, and he is our cook,
butler, chambermaid, laundress, beast of burden, and interpreter,
all in one.”</p>

<p>The man to whom the professor alluded was at this
moment seen crawling on his hands and knees through the
low door-way, which his bulky figure completely filled.
He was a Norwegian peasant of the ordinary sort, with
a square, rudely cut face, dull blue eyes, and a tuft of
towy hair hanging down over his forehead. With one
hand he was dragging the skin of the buck, and between
his teeth he held an ugly-looking knife.</p>

<p>“Ve haf got to bury him,” he said.</p>

<p>“Bury him!” cried Harry. “Why, you blood-thirsty
wretch, don’t you see he is sitting there, looking as
bright as a sixpence?”</p>

<p>“I mean de buck,” replied Gunnar, imperturbably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>“And why do you wish to bury the buck? I would
much rather eat him. This steak here has a most tempting
flavor, and I am quite tired of canned abominations
by this time.”</p>

<p>“De volves vill be sure to scent de meat, now dat it is
flayed, and before an hour ve might haf a whole congregation
of dem here.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, we will shoot them down,” insisted the
cheerful Harry. “Come, now, Uncle, and let us have a
civilized dinner. I don’t pretend to be an expert in the
noble art of cookery; but if this tastes as good as it
smells, I wouldn’t exchange it for a Delmonico banquet.
And if the wolves, as Gunnar says, can smell a dead
reindeer miles away, they would be likely to smell a
venison steak from the ends of creation. Perhaps, if we
don’t hurry, all the wolves of the earth may invite themselves
to our dinner.”</p>

<p>Gunnar, upon whom this fanciful raillery was lost, was
still standing on all-fours in the door, with his front half
in the warm room and his rearward portion in the arctic
regions without. He was gazing helplessly from one to
another, as if asking for an explanation of all this superfluous
talk. “Vill you cawme and help me, Mester
Harry?” he asked at last, stolidly.</p>

<p>“Yes, when I have had my dinner I will, Mester
Gunnar,” answered Harry, gayly.</p>

<p>“Vel, I haf notting more to say, den,” grumbled the
guide; “but it vould vonder me much if, before you are
troo, you von’t have some unbidden guests.”</p>

<p>“All right, Gunnar&mdash;the more the merrier,” retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Harry as, with exaggerated imitation of a waiter’s manner,
he distributed plates, knives, and napkins to Magnie
and his uncle.</p>

<p>They now fell to chatting, and Magnie learned, after
having given a brief account of himself, that his entertainers
were Professor Winchester, an American geologist,
and his nephew, Harry Winchester, who was accompanying
his uncle, chiefly for the fun of the thing, and also
for the purpose of seeing the world and picking up some
crumbs of scientific knowledge. The professor was
especially interested in glaciers and their action in ages
past upon the surface of the earth, and, as the Norwegian
glaciers had never been thoroughly studied, he had
determined to devote a couple of months to observations
and measurements, with a view to settling some
mooted geological questions upon which he had almost
staked his reputation.</p>

<p>They had just finished the steak, which would perhaps
have been tenderer if it had not been so fresh, and
were helping themselves to the contents of a jar of raspberry
preserves, when Harry suddenly dropped his spoon
and turned, with a serious face, to his uncle.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that?” he said.</p>

<p>“No; what was it?”</p>

<p>Harry waited for a minute; then, as a wild, doleful
howl was heard, he laid his hand on the professor’s arm,
and remarked: “The old fellow was right. We shall
have unbidden guests.”</p>

<p>“But they are hardly dangerous in these regions, so
far as I can learn,” said the professor, reassuringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“That depends upon their number. We could tackle
a dozen; but two dozen we might find troublesome. At
any rate, they have spoiled my appetite for raspberry
jam, and that is something I sha’n’t soon forgive them.”</p>

<p>Three or four howls sounding nearer, and echoing with
terrible distinctness from the glaciers, seemed to depress
Harry’s spirits still further, and he put the jar away and
began to examine the lock of his rifle.</p>

<p>“They are evidently summoning a mass-meeting,” remarked
the professor, as another chorus of howls re-echoed
from the glacier. “I wish we had more guns.”</p>

<p>“And I wish mine were a Remington or a Springfield
breech-loader, with a dozen cartridges in it!” Harry exclaimed.
“These double-barrelled Norwegian machines,
with two shots in them, are really good for nothing in an
emergency. They are antediluvian both in shape and
construction.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely finished this lament, when Gunnar’s
huge form reappeared in the door, quadruped fashion,
and made an attempt to enter. But his great bulk
nearly filled the narrow room, and made it impossible for
the others to move. He examined silently first Harry’s
rifle, then his own, cut off a slice of steak with his pocket-knife,
and was about to crawl out again, when the professor,
who could not quite conceal his anxiety, asked
him what he had done with the reindeer.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he answered, triumphantly, “I haf buried him
among de stones, vhere he vill be safe from all de volves
in de vorld.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow,” ejaculated the professor, hotly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
“why didn’t you rather let the wolves have it? Then,
at least, they would spare us.”</p>

<p>“You surely vouldn’t gif a goot fresh reindeer, legs
and all, to a pack of skountrelly volves, vould you?”</p>

<p>“I would much rather give them that than give them
myself.”</p>

<p>“But it is vort tventy dollars, if you can get it down
fresh and sell it to de English yachts,” protested Gunnar,
stolidly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; but you great stupid,” cried the professor
in despair, “what do you think my life is worth? and
Master Harry’s? and this young fellow’s?” (pointing to
Magnie). “Now go as quick as you can and dig the
deer out again.”</p>

<p>Gunnar, scarcely able to comprehend such criminal
wastefulness, was backing out cautiously with his feet
foremost, when suddenly he gave a scream and a jump
which nearly raised the roof from the hut. It was evident
that he had been bitten. In the same moment a
fresh chorus of howls resounded without, mingled with
sharp, whining barks, expressive of hunger and ferocity.
There was something shudderingly wild and mournful in
these long-drawn discords, as they rose toward the sky in
this lonely desert; and brave as he was, Magnie could
not restrain the terror which he felt stealing upon him.
Weakened by his icy bath, moreover, and by the nervous
strain of his first adventure, he had no great desire to encounter
a pack of ravenous wolves. Still, he manned
himself for the occasion and, in as steady a voice as he
could command, begged the professor to hand him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
weapon. Harry, who had instinctively taken the lead,
had just time to reach him a long hunting-knife, and arm
his uncle with an ax, when, through the door which
Gunnar had left open, two wolves came leaping in and
paused in bewilderment at the sight of the fire on the
hearth. They seemed dazed by the light, and stood
panting and blinking, with their trembling red tongues
lolling out of their mouths. Harry, whose gun was useless
at such close range, snatched the ax away from the
professor, and at one blow split the skull of one of the
intruders, while Magnie ran his knife up to the very hilt
in the neck of the other. The beast was, however, by no
means dead after that, but leaped up on his assailant’s
chest, and would have given him an ugly wound in the
neck had not the professor torn it away and flung it
down upon the fire, where, with a howling whine, it expired.
The professor had also found time to bolt the
door before more visitors could enter; and two successive
shots without seemed to indicate that Gunnar was
holding his own against the pack. But the question was,
how long would he succeed in keeping them at bay? He
had fired both his shots, and he would scarcely have a
chance to load again, with the hungry beasts leaping
about him. This they read in one another’s faces, but
no one was anxious to anticipate the other in uttering
his dread.</p>

<p>“Help, help!” cried Gunnar, in dire need.</p>

<p>“Take your hand away, Uncle!” demanded Harry.
“I am going out to help him.”</p>

<p>“For your life’s sake, Harry,” implored the professor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
“don’t go! Let me go! What would your mother say
to me if I should return without you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll come back again, Uncle, don’t you fear,” said the
youth, with feigned cheerfulness; “but I won’t let this
poor fellow perish before my very eyes, even though he
is a fool.”</p>

<p>“It was his foolishness which brought this danger
upon us,” remonstrated the professor.</p>

<p>“He knew no better,” cried Harry, tearing the door
open, and with ax uplifted rushing out <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: ‘into the the twilight’">into the twilight</ins>.
What he saw seemed merely a dark mass, huddled
together and swaying sideways, from which now
and then a black figure detached itself with a howl,
jumped wildly about, and again joined the dark, struggling
mass. He could distinguish Gunnar’s head, and
his arms fighting desperately, and, from the yelps and
howls of the wolves, he concluded that he had thrown
away the rifle and was using his knife with good effect.</p>

<p>“Help!” he yelled, “help!”</p>

<p>“You shall have it, old fellow,” cried Harry, plunging
forward and swinging his ax about him; and the professor,
who had followed close at his heels, shouting at
the top of his voice, pressed in Harry’s wake right into
the centre of the furious pack. But, at that very instant,
there came a long “Hallo-o!” from the lake below,
and a rifle-bullet flew whistling above their heads
and struck a rock scarcely a yard above the professor’s
hat. Several wolves lay gasping and yelping on the
ground, and the rest slunk aside. Another shot followed,
and a large beast made a leap and fell dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
among the stones. Gunnar, who was lying bleeding
upon the ground, was helped to his feet, and supported
by Harry and the professor to the door of the cottage.</p>

<p>“Hallo, there!” shouted Harry, in response to the
call from below.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” someone shouted back.</p>

<p>The figures of three men were now seen looming up
in the dusk, and Magnie, who instinctively knew who
they were, sprang to meet them, and in another moment
lay sobbing in his brother’s arms. The poor lad was so
completely unnerved by the prolonged suspense and excitement,
that he had to be carried back into the hut,
and his brother, after having hurriedly introduced himself
to the professor, came very near giving way to his
feelings, too. Gunnar’s wounds, which were numerous,
though not serious, were washed and bandaged by Grim
Hering-Luck; and having been wrapped in a horse-blanket,
to keep out the cold, he was stowed away in a
bunk and was soon asleep. As the hut was too small to
admit all the company at once, Grim and Bjarne remained
outside, and busied themselves in skinning the
seven wolves which had fallen on the field of battle.
Harry, who had got a bad bite in his arm, which he refused
to regard as serious, consented with reluctance to
his uncle’s surgery, and insisted upon sitting up and conversing
with Olaf Birk, to whom he had taken a great
liking. But after a while the conversation began to lag,
and tired heads began to droop; and when, about midnight,
Grim crept in to see how his invalid was doing,
he found the professor reclining on some loose moss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
upon the floor, while Harry was snoring peacefully in a
bunk, using Olaf’s back for a pillow. And Olaf, in spite
of his uncomfortable attitude, seemed also to have found
his way to the land of Nod. Grim, knowing the danger
of exposure in this cold glacier air, covered them all up
with skins and horse-blankets, threw a few dry sticks
upon the fire, and resumed his post as sentinel at the
door.</p>

<p>The next morning Professor Winchester and his
nephew accepted Olaf’s invitation to spend a few days at
Hasselrud, and without further adventures the whole
caravan descended into the valley, calling on their way
at the <i lang="no" xml:lang="no">saeter</i> where Edwin had been left. It appeared,
when they came to discuss the strange incidents of the
preceding day, that it was Magnie’s silk handkerchief
which had enabled them to track him to the edge of the
lake, and, by means of a raft, which Bjarne kept hidden
among the stones in a little bay, they had been enabled
to cross, leaving their horses in charge of a shepherd boy
whom they had found tending goats close by.</p>

<p>The reindeer cow which Olaf had killed was safely
carried down to the valley, and two wolf-skins were presented
to Magnie by Harry Winchester. The other
wolf-skins, as well as the skin of the reindeer buck,
Bjarne prepared in a special manner, and Harry looked
forward with much pleasure to seeing them as rugs upon
the floor of his room at college; and he positively
swelled with pride when he imagined himself relating to
his admiring fellow-students the adventures which had
brought him these precious possessions.</p>

<h2><a name="THORWALD_AND_THE_STAR-CHILDREN" id="THORWALD_AND_THE_STAR-CHILDREN"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">THORWALD AND THE STAR-CHILDREN.</a></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Thorwald’s mother was very ill. The fever burned
and throbbed in her veins; she lay, all day long and all
night long, with her eyes wide open, and could not sleep.
The doctor sat at her bedside and looked at her through
his spectacles; but she grew worse instead of better.</p>

<p>“Unless she can sleep a sound, natural sleep,” he said,
“there is no hope for her, I fear.”</p>

<p>It was to Thorwald’s father that he said this, but
Thorwald heard what he said. The little boy, with his
dog Hector, was sitting mournfully upon the great wolfskin
outside his mother’s door.</p>

<p>“Is my mamma very ill?” he asked the doctor, but
the tears choked his voice, and he hid his face in the hair
of Hector’s shaggy neck.</p>

<p>“Yes, child,” answered the doctor; “very ill.”</p>

<p>“And will God take my mamma away from me?” he
faltered, extricating himself from Hector’s embrace, and
trying hard to steady his voice and look brave.</p>

<p>“I am afraid He will, my child,” said the doctor, gravely.</p>

<p>“But could I not do something for her, doctor?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The long suppressed tears now broke forth, and trickled
down over the boy’s cheeks.</p>

<p>“<em>You</em>, a child, what can you do?” said the doctor,
kindly, and shook his head.</p>

<p>Just then there was a great noise in the air. The
chimes in the steeple of the village church pealed forth a
joyous Christmas carol, and the sound soared, rushing as
with invisible wing-beats through the clear, frosty air.
For it was Christmas-eve, and the bells were, according
to Norse custom, “ringing-in the festival.” Thorwald
stood long listening, with folded hands, until the bells
seemed to take up the doctor’s last words, and chime:
“What can you do, what can you do, what can you do?”
Surely, there could be no doubt that that was what the
bells were saying. The clear little silvery bells that rang
out the high notes were every moment growing more impatient,
and now the great heavy bell joined them, too, and
tolled out slowly, in a deep bass voice, “Thor&mdash;wald!”
and then all the little ones chimed in with the chorus, as
rapidly as the stiff iron tongues could wag: “What can
you do, what can you do, what can you do? Thorwald,
what can you do, what can you do, what can you do?”</p>

<p>“A child&mdash;ah, what can a child do?” thought Thorwald.
“Christ was himself a child once, and He saved
the whole world. And on a night like this, when all the
world is glad because it is His birthday, He perhaps will
remember how a little boy feels who loves his mamma,
and cannot bear to lose her. If I only knew where He
is now, I would go to Him, even if it were ever so far,
and tell Him how much we all love mamma, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
would promise Him to be the best boy in all the world,
if He would allow her to stay with us.”</p>

<p>Now the church-bells suddenly stopped, though the
air still kept quivering for some minutes with faint reverberations
of sound. It was very quiet in the large,
old-fashioned house. The servants stole about on tiptoe,
and spoke to each other in hurried whispers when they
met in the halls. A dim lamp, with a bluish globe, hung
under the ceiling and sent a faint, moon-like light over
the broad oaken staircase, upon the first landing of which
a large Dutch clock stood in a sort of niche, and ticked
and ticked patiently in the twilight. It was only five
o’clock in the afternoon, and yet the moon had been up
for more than an hour, and the stars were twinkling in
the sky, and the aurora borealis swept with broad sheets
of light through the air, like a huge fan, the handle of
which was hidden beneath the North Pole; you almost
imagined you heard it whizzing past your ears as it flashed
upward to the zenith and flared along the horizon. For at
that season of the year the sun sets at about two o’clock in
the northern part of Norway, and the day is then but four
hours long, while the night is twenty. To Thorwald that
was a perfectly proper and natural arrangement; for he
had always known it so in winter, and he would have
found it very singular if the sun had neglected to hide behind
the mountains at about two o’clock on Christmas-eve.</p>

<p>But poor Thorwald heeded little the wonders of the
sky that day. He heard the clock going, “Tick&mdash;tack,
tick&mdash;tack,” and he knew that the precious moments
were flying, and he had not yet decided what he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
do which might please God so well that he would consent
to let his dear mamma remain upon earth. He
thought of making a vow to be very good all his life
long; but it occurred to him that before he would have
time to prove the sincerity of his promise, God might
already have taken his mamma away. He must find
some shorter and surer method. Down on the knoll,
near the river, he knew there lived a woman whom all
the peasants held in great repute, and who was known in
the parish as “Wise Marthie.” He had always been
half afraid of her, because she was very old and wrinkled,
and looked so much like the fairy godmother in his storybook,
who was not invited to the christening feast, and
who revenged herself by stinging the princess with a
spindle, so that she had to go to sleep for a hundred years.
But if she were so wise, as all the people said, perhaps
she might tell him what he should do to save the life of
his mamma. Hardly had this thought struck him before
he seized his cap and overcoat (for it was a bitter
cold night), and ran to the stable to fetch his skees.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Then down he slid over the steep hill-side. The wind
whistled in his ears, and the loose snow whirled about
him and settled in his hair, and all over his trousers and
his coat. When he reached Wise Marthie’s cottage,
down on the knoll, he looked like a wandering snow
image. He paused for a moment at the door; then took
heart and gave three bold raps with his skee-staff. He
heard someone groping about within, and at length a
square hole in the door was opened, and the head of the
revengeful fairy godmother was thrust out through the
opening.</p>

<p>“Who is there?” asked Wise Marthie, harshly (for, of
course, it was none other than she). Then as she saw
the small boy, covered all over with snow, she added, in
a friendlier voice: “Ah! gentlefolk out walking in this
rough weather?”</p>

<p>“O Marthie!” cried Thorwald, anxiously, “my mamma
is very ill&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He wished to say more, but Marthie here opened the
lower panel of the door, while the upper one remained
closed, and invited him to enter.</p>

<p>“Bend your head,” she said, “or you will knock against
the door. I am a poor woman, and can’t afford to waste
precious heat by opening both panels.”</p>

<p>Thorwald shook the snow from his coat, set his skees
against the wall outside, and entered the cottage.</p>

<p>“Take a seat here at the fire,” said the old woman,
pointing to a wooden block which stood close to the
hearth. “You must be very cold, and you can warm
your hands while you tell me your errand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thank you, Marthie,” answered the boy, “but I
have no time to sit down. I only wanted to ask you
something, and if you can tell me that, I shall&mdash;I shall&mdash;love
you as long as I live.”</p>

<p>Old Marthie smiled, and Thorwald thought for a moment
that she looked almost handsome. And then she
took his hand in hers and drew him gently to her side.</p>

<p>“You are not a witch, are you, Marthie?” he said, a
little tremblingly. For Marthie’s association with the
wicked fairy godmother was yet very suggestive. Then,
again, her cottage seemed to be a very queer place; and
it did not look like any other cottage that he had ever
seen before. Up under the ceiling, which was black and
sooty, hung bunches of dried herbs, and on shelves along
the wall stood flower-pots, some of which had blooming
flowers in them. The floor was freshly scrubbed, and
strewn with juniper-needles, and the whole room smelt
very clean. In a corner, between the stone hearth and
the wall, a bed, made of plain deal boards, was to be
seen; a shaggy Maltese cat, with sleepy, yellow eyes,
was for the present occupying it, and he raised his head
and gazed knowingly at the visitor, as if to say: “I
know what you have come for.”</p>

<p>Old Marthie chuckled when Thorwald asked if she
was a witch; and somehow her chuckle had a pleasant
and good-natured sound, the boy thought, as he eyed
her wistfully.</p>

<p>“Now I am sure you are not a witch,” cried he, “for
witches never laugh like that. I know, now, that you
are a good woman, and that you will want to help me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
if you can. I told you my mamma was very ill” (the
tears here again broke through his voice)&mdash;“so very ill
that the doctor says God will take her away from us. I
sat at her door all yesterday and cried, and when papa
took me in to her, she did not know me. Then I cried
more. I asked papa why God makes people so ill, and
he said it was something I didn’t understand, but I
should understand some day. But, Marthie, I haven’t
time to wait, for by that time mamma may be gone, and
I shall never know where to find her; I must know
now. And you, who are so very wise, you will tell me
what I can do to save my mamma. Couldn’t I do
something for God, Marthie&mdash;something that he would
like? And then, perhaps, he would allow mamma to
stay with us always.”</p>

<p>The tears now came hot and fast, but the boy still
stood erect, and gazed with anxious questioning into the
old woman’s face.</p>

<p>“You are a brave little lad,” she said, stroking his
soft, curly hair with her stiff, crooked fingers, “and
happy is the mother of such a boy. And old Marthie
knows a thing or two, she also, and you shall not have
come to her in vain. Once, child, more than eighteen
hundred years ago, just on this very night, a strange
thing happened in this world, and I dare say you have
heard of it. Christ, the White, was born of Mary in the
land of the Jews. The angels came down from heaven,
as we read in the Good Book, and they sang strange
and wonderful songs of praise. And they scattered
flowers, too&mdash;flowers which only blossomed until then in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
heaven, in the sight of God. And one of these flowers,&mdash;sweet
and pure, like the tone of an angel’s voice expressed
in color&mdash;one of these wondrous flowers, I say,
struck root in the soil, and has multiplied, and remains
in the world until this day. It blossoms only on Christmas-eve&mdash;on
the eve when Christ was born. Even in
the midst of the snow, and when it is so cold that the
wolf shivers in his den, this frail, pure flower peeps up
for a few brief moments above the shining white surface,
and then is not seen again. It is of a white or faintly
bluish color; and he who touches it and inhales its
heavenly odor is immediately healed of every earthly disease.
But there is one singular thing about it&mdash;no one
can see it unless he be pure and innocent and good; to
all others the heavenly flower is invisible.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then I shall never find it, Marthie!” cried
Thorwald, in great suspense. “For I have often been
very naughty.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to hear that,” said Marthie, and
shook her head.</p>

<p>“And do you think it is of any use for me, then, to
try to find the flower?” exclaimed the boy, wildly.
“O Marthie, help me! Help me!”</p>

<p>“Well, I think I should try,” said Marthie, calmly.
“I don’t believe you can have been such a dreadfully
naughty boy; and you probably were very sorry whenever
you happened to do something wrong.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, always, and I always begged papa’s and
mamma’s pardon.”</p>

<p>“Then, listen to me! I will show you the Star of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Bethlehem in the sky&mdash;the same one that led the shepherds
and the kings of the East to the manger where
Christ lay. Follow that straight on, through the forest,
across the frozen river, wherever it may lead you, until
you find the heavenly flower. And when you have
found it, hasten home to your mother, and put it up to
her lips so that she may inhale its breath; then she will
be healed, and will bless her little boy, who shunned no
sacrifice for her sake.”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t tell you, Marthie, that I made Grim
Hering-Luck tattoo a ship on my right arm, although
papa had told me that I mustn’t do it. Do you still
think I shall find the heavenly flower?”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if you did, child,” responded
Marthie, with a reassuring nod of her head. “It is
high time for you to start, now, and you mustn’t loiter
by the way.”</p>

<p>“No, no; you need not tell me that!” cried the boy,
seizing his cap eagerly, and slipping out through the
lower panel of the door. He jumped into the bands of
his skees, and cast his glance up to the vast nocturnal
sky, which glittered with myriads of twinkling stars.
Which of all these was the Star of Bethlehem? He was
just about to rush back into the cottage, when he felt a
hand upon his shoulder, and saw Wise Marthie’s kindly
but withered face close to his.</p>

<p>“Look toward the east, child,” she said, almost
solemnly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where the east is, Marthie,” said Thorwald,
dolefully. “I always get mixed up about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
points of the compass. If they would only fix four big
poles, one in each corner of the earth, that everybody
could see, then I should always know where to turn.”</p>

<p>“There is the east,” said Marthie, pointing with a
long, crooked finger toward the distant mountain-tops,
which, with their hoods of ice, flashed and glistened in
the moonlight. “Do you see that bright, silvery star
which is just rising between those two snowy peaks?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Marthie. I see it! I see it!”</p>

<p>“That is the Star of Bethlehem. You will know it by
its white, radiant light. Follow that, and its rays will
lead you to the flower which can conquer Death, as it
led the shepherds and the kings of old to Him over
whom Death had no power.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Marthie. Thank you!”</p>

<p>The second “thank you” hardly reached the ears of
the old woman, for the boy had shot like an arrow down
over the steep bank, and was now half-way out upon the
ice. The snow surged and danced in eddies behind
him, and the cold stung his face like sharp, tiny needles.
But he hardly minded it, for he saw the star of Bethlehem
beaming large and radiant upon the blue horizon,
and he thought of his dear mother, whom he was to
rescue from the hands of Death. But the flower&mdash;the
flower&mdash;where was that? He searched carefully all
about him in the snow, but he saw no trace of it. “I
wonder,” he thought, “if it can blossom in the snow?
I should rather think that Christ allows the angels to
fling down a few of them every year on his birthday, to
help those that are sick and suffering; they say he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
very kind and good, and I shouldn’t wonder if he sees
me now, and will tell the angels to throw down the
precious flower right in my path.”</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The world was cold and white round about him.
The tall pines stood wrapped in cloaks of snow, which
looked like great white ulsters, and they were buttoned
straight up to the chin&mdash;only a green finger-tip and a
few tufts of dark-green hair showed faintly, at the end of
the sleeves and above the collar. The alders and the
birches, who had no such comfortable coats to keep out
the cold, stood naked in the keen light of the stars and
the aurora, and they shivered to the very marrow. To
Thorwald it seemed as if they were stretching their bare,
lean hands against the heavens, praying for warmer
weather. A family of cedar-birds, who had lovely red
caps on their heads and gray uniforms of the most fashionable
tint, had snugged close together on a sheltered
pine-branch, and they were carrying on a subdued twittering
conversation just as Thorwald passed the river-bank,
pushing himself rapidly over the snow by means of
his skee-staff. But it was strictly a family matter they
were discussing, which it would be indiscreet in me to
divulge. They did, however, shake down a handful of
loose snow on Thorwald’s head, just to let him know
that he was very impolite to take so little notice of them.
They did not know, of course, that his mother was ill;
otherwise, I am sure, they would have forgiven him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Hush! What was that? Thorwald thought he heard
distant voices behind him in the snow. He looked all
about him, but saw nothing. Then, following the guidance
of the star, he still pressed onward. He quitted
the river-bed and traversed a wide sloping meadow; he
had to take a zigzag course, like a ship that is tacking,
because the slope was too steep to ascend in a straight
line. He was beginning to feel tired. The muscles in
his legs ached, and he often shifted the staff from hand
to hand, in order to rest the one or the other of his
arms. He gazed now fixedly upon the snow, taking
only an occasional glance at the sky, to see that he was
going in the right direction; the strange hum of voices
in the air yet haunted his ears, and he sometimes imagined
he heard words moving to a wonderful melody.
Was it the angels that were singing, inspiring him with
courage for his quest? He dared hardly believe it, and
yet his heart beat joyously at the thought. Ah! what is
that which glitters so strangely in the snow? A starry
gleam, a twinkling, like a spark gathering its light into a
little glittering point, just as it is about to be quenched.
Thorwald leaps from his skees and plunges his hand into
the snow. The frozen crust cuts his wrist cruelly; and
he feels that he is bleeding. With a wrench he pulls his
hand up; his heart throbs in his throat; he gazes with
wild expectation, but sees&mdash;nothing. His wrist is bleeding,
and his hand is full of blood. Poor Thorwald could
hardly trust his eyes. He certainly had seen something
glittering on the snow. He felt a great lump in his
throat, and it would have been a great relief to him, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that moment, to sit down and give vent to the tears that
were crowding to his eyelids. But just then a clear,
sweet strain of music broke through the air, and Thorwald
heard distinctly these words, sung by voices of
children:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Lead, O Star of Bethlehem,</p>
<p class="verse4">Me through death and danger,</p>
<p class="verse">Unto Christ, who on this night</p>
<p class="verse4">Lay cradled in a manger.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>Thorwald gathered all his strength and again leaped
into his skees; he was now on the border of a dense
pine-forest, and as he looked into it, he could not help
shuddering. It was so dark under the thick, snow-burdened
branches, and the moon only broke through here
and there, and scattered patches of light over the tree-tops
and on the white carpet of the snow. Yet, perhaps
it was within this very wood that the heavenly
blossom had fallen. He must not lose heart now, when
he was perhaps so near his goal. Thrusting his staff
vigorously into the snow-crust, he pushed himself forward
and glided in between the tall, silent trunks; at
the same moment the air again quivered lightly, as
with the breath of invisible beings, and he heard words
which, as far as he could afterward recollect them,
sounded as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Make my soul as white and pure</p>
<p class="verse4">As the heavenly blossom&mdash;</p>
<p class="verse">As the flower of grace and truth</p>
<p class="verse4">That blooms upon Thy bosom.”</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>
<p>Thorwald hardly felt the touch of the snow beneath his
feet; he seemed rather to be soaring through the air, and
the trunks of the huge dark trees marched in close columns,
like an army in rapid retreat, before his enraptured
vision. Christ did see him! Christ would send him the
heavenly flower! All over the snow sparkling stars were
scattered, and they gleamed and twinkled and beckoned
to him, but whenever he stretched out his hand for them
they suddenly vanished. The trees began to assume
strange, wild shapes, and to resemble old men and
women, with long beards and large hooked noses. They
nodded knowingly to one another, and raised up their
gnarled toes from the ground in which they were rooted,
and tried to trip up the little boy who had dared to interrupt
their solemn conversation. One old fir shook
the snow from her shoulders, and stretched out a long,
strangely twisted arm, and was on the point of seizing
Thorwald by the hair, when fortunately he saw the
coming danger, and darted away down the hill-side
at quickened speed. A long, bright streak of light
suddenly illuminated the eastern sky, something fell
through the air, and left a golden trail of fire behind
it; surely it was the heavenly flower that was thrown
down by an angel in response to his prayer! Forward
and ever forward&mdash;over roots and stumps and stones&mdash;stumbling,
rising again, sinking from weariness and exhaustion,
kneeling to pray on the frozen snow, crawling
painfully back and tottering into the skee-bands; but
only forward, ever forward! The earth rolls with a
surging motion under his feet, the old trees join their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
rugged hands and dance, in wild, senile glee, around
him, lifting their twisted limbs, and sometimes, with
their talons, trying to sweep the stars from the sky.
Thorwald struggled with all his force to break through
the ring they had made around him. He saw plainly
the flower, beaming with a pale radiance upon the snow,
and he strove with all his might to reach it, but something
held him back, and though he was once or twice
within an inch of it, he could never quite grasp it with
his fingers. Then, all of a sudden, the strange song
again vibrated through the air, and he saw a huge star
glittering among the underbrush; a flock of children clad
in white robes were dancing about it, and they were singing
Christmas carols in praise of the new-born Saviour.
As they approached nearer and nearer, the hope revived
in Thorwald’s heart. Ah, there the flower of healing
was, lying close at his feet. He made a desperate leap
and clutched it in his grasp&mdash;then saw and felt no more.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The white children were children of earth, not, as
Thorwald had imagined, angels from heaven. It is a
custom in Norway for the children of the poor to go
about on Christmas eve, from house to house, carrying a
large canvas star, with one or more lanterns within it,
and sing Christmas carols. They are always dressed in
white robes, and people call them star-children. Whenever
they station themselves in the snow before the front
door, and lift up their tiny, shrill voices, old and young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
crowd to the windows, and the little boys and girls who
are born to comfort and plenty, and never have known
want, throw pennies to them, and wish them a merry
Christmas. When they have finished singing, they are
invited in to share in the mirth of the children of the
house, and are made to sit down with them to the Christmas
table, and perhaps to dance with them around the
Christmas tree.</p>

<p>It was a company of these star-children who now
found Thorwald lying senseless in the forest, and whose
sweet voices he had heard in the distance. The oldest
of them, a boy of twelve, hung up his star on the branch
of a fir-tree, and stooped down over the pale little face,
which, from the force of the fall, was half buried in the
snow. He lifted Thorwald’s head and gazed anxiously
into his features, while the others stood in a ring about
him, staring with wide-open eyes and frightened faces.</p>

<p>“This is Thorwald, the judge’s son,” he said. “Come,
boys, we must carry him home. He must have been
taken ill while he was running on skees. But let us first
make a litter of branches to carry him on.”</p>

<p>The boys all fell to work with a will, cutting flexible
twigs with their pocket-knives, and the little girls sat
down on the snow and twined them firmly together, for
they were used to work, and, indeed, some of them made
their living by weaving baskets. In a few minutes the
litter was ready, and Thorwald, who was still unconscious,
was laid upon it. Then six boys took hold, one
at each corner and two in the middle, and as the crust
of the snow was very thick, and strong enough to bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
them, it was only once or twice that any of them broke
through. When they reached the river, however, they
were very tired, and were obliged for a while to halt.
Some one proposed that they should sing as they walked,
as that would make the time pass more quickly, and
make their burden seem lighter, and immediately some
one began a beautiful Christmas carol, and all the others
joined in with one accord. It was a pretty sight to see
them as they went marching across the river, one small
boy of six walking at the head of the procession, carrying
the great star, then the six larger boys carrying the
litter, and at last twelve little white-robed girls, tripping
two abreast over the shining surface of the ice. But, in
spite of their singing, they were very tired by the time
they had gained the highway on the other side of the
river. They did not like to confess it; but when they
saw the light from Wise Marthie’s windows, the oldest
boy proposed that they should stop there for a few minutes
to rest, and the other five said, in a careless sort of
way, that they had no objection. Only the girls were a
wee bit frightened, because they had heard that Wise
Marthie was a witch. The boys, however, laughed at
that, and the little fellow with the star ran forward and
knocked at the door, with Thorwald’s skee-staff.</p>

<p>“Lord ha’ mercy on us!” cried Marthie, as she opened
the peeping-hole in her door, and saw the insensible form
which the boys bore between them; then flinging open
both portions of the door, she rushed out, snatched Thorwald
up in her arms, and carried him into the cottage.</p>

<p>“Come in, children,” she said, “come in and warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
yourselves for a moment. Then hurry up to the judge’s,
and tell the folk there that the little lad is here at my
cottage. You will not go away empty-handed; for the
judge is a man who pays for more than he gets. And
this boy, you know, is the apple of his eye. Lord!
Lord! I sent his dog, Hector, after him, and I knew the
beast would let me know if the boy came to harm; but,
likely as not, the wind was the wrong way, and the poor
beast could not trace the skee-track on the frozen snow.
Mercy! mercy! and he is in a dead swoon.”</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>When Thorwald waked up, he lay in his bed, in his own
room, and in his hand he held a pale-blue flower. He
saw the doctor standing at his bedside.</p>

<p>“Mamma&mdash;my mamma,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is time that we should go to your mamma,”
said the doctor, and his voice shook.</p>

<p>And he took the boy by the hand and led him to his
mother’s bed-chamber. Thorwald began to tremble&mdash;a
terrible dread had come over him; but he clutched the
flower convulsively, and prayed that he might not come
too late. A dim, shaded lamp burned in a corner of the
room, his father was sitting on a chair, resting his head
in his palms, and weeping. To his astonishment, he saw
an old woman stooping over the pillow where his mother’s
head lay; it was Wise Marthie. Unable to contain
himself any longer, he rushed, breathless with excitement,
up to the bedside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mamma! Mamma!” he cried, flourishing his prize
in the air. “I am going to make you well. Look
here!”</p>

<p>He thrust the flower eagerly into her face, gazing all
the while exultantly into her beloved features.</p>

<p>“My sweet, my darling child,” whispered she, while
her eyes kindled with a heavenly joy. “How can a
mother die who has such a noble son?”</p>

<p>And she clasped her little boy in her arms, and drew
him close to her bosom. Thus they lay long, weeping for
joy&mdash;mother and son. An hour later the doctor stole
on tiptoe toward the bed, and found them both sleeping.</p>

<p>When the morrow’s sun peeped in through the white
curtains, the mother awoke from her long, health-giving
slumber; but Thorwald lay yet peacefully sleeping at her
side. And as the mother’s glance fell upon the flower, now
limp and withered, yet clutched tightly in the little grimy,
scratched and frost-bitten fist, the tears&mdash;happy tears&mdash;again
blinded her eyes. She stretched out her hand,
took the withered flower, pressed it to her lips, and then
hid it next to her heart. And there she wears it in a
locket of gold until this day.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>On the northwestern coast of Norway the mountains
hide their heads in the clouds and dip their feet in the
sea. In fact, the cliffs are in some places so tall and
steep that streams, flowing from the inland glaciers and
plunging over their sides, vanish in the air, being blown
in a misty spray out over the ocean. In other places
there may be a narrow slope, where a few potatoes, some
garden vegetables, and perhaps even a patch of wheat,
may be induced to grow by dint of much coaxing; for
the summer, though short, is mild and genial in those
high latitudes, and has none of that fierce intensity which,
with us, forces the vegetation into sudden maturity, and
sends our people flying toward all the points of the compass
during the first weeks in June.</p>

<p>It was on such a sunny little slope, right under the
black mountain-wall, that Halvor Myrbraaten had built
his cottage. Halvor was a merry fellow, who went about
humming snatches of hymns and old songs and dance-melodies
all day long, and sometimes mixed up both
words and tune wofully; and when his memory failed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
him, sang anything that popped into his head. Some people
said they had heard him humming the multiplication
table to the tune of “Old Norway’s Lion,” and whole
pages out of Luther’s Catechism to jolly dance-tunes.
Not that he ever meant to be irreverent; it was just his
way of amusing himself. He was an odd stick, people
thought, and not of much use to his family. Whatever
he did, “luck” went against him. But it affected his
temper very little. Halvor was still light-hearted and
good-natured, and went about humming as usual.
If he went out hunting, and came home with an
empty pouch, it did not interfere in the least with his
gayety; but knowing well the reception which was in
store for him; it did occasionally happen that he paused
with a quizzical look before opening the door, and perhaps,
after a minute’s reflection, concluded to spend the
night in the barn; for Turid, his wife, had a mind of her
own, and knew how to express herself with emphasis.
She was, as everyone admitted, a very worthy and competent
woman, and accomplished more in a day than her
husband did in a fortnight. But worthy and competent
people are not invariably the pleasantest people to associate
with, and the gay and genial good-for-nothing Halvor,
with his bright irresponsible smile and his pleasant
ways, was a far more popular person in the parish than
his austere, estimable, over-worked wife. For one thing,
with all her poverty, she had a great deal of pride; and
people who had never suspected that one so poor could
have any objection to receiving alms had been much
offended by her curt way of refusing their proffered gifts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Halvor, they said, showed a more realizing sense of his
position: he had the humble and contrite heart which
was becoming in an unsuccessful man, and accepted with
equal cheerfulness and gratitude whatever was offered
him, from a dollar bill to a pair of worn-out mittens. It
was, in fact, this extreme readiness to accept things which
first made difficulty between Halvor and his wife. It
seemed to him a pure waste of labor to work for a thing
which he could get for nothing; and it seemed to her a
waste of something still more precious to accept as a gift
what one might have honestly earned by work. But as
she could never hope to have Halvor agree with her on
this point, she comforted herself by impressing her own
horror of alms-taking upon her children; and the children,
in their turn, impressed the same sound principles upon
their pet kid and the pussy cat.</p>

<p>There were five children at Myrbraaten. Hans, the
eldest, was ten years old, and Dolly, the youngest, was
one, and the rest were scattered between. It was a pretty
sight to see them of a summer afternoon on the grass
plot before the house, rolling over one another and gambolling
like a sportive family of kittens; only you could
hardly help feeling vaguely uneasy about the mountain,
the steep, black wall of which, sparsely clad with pines,
rose so threateningly above them. It seemed as if it
must, some day, swoop down upon them and crush them.
The mother, it must be admitted, was occasionally oppressed
by some such fear; but when she reflected that
the mountain had stood there from time immemorial,
and had never yet moved, or harmed anyone, she felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
ashamed of her apprehension, and blamed herself for her
distrust of God’s providence.</p>

<p>Besides the children there was another young inhabitant
of the Myrbraaten cottage, and surely a very important
one. He too, was named Hans, but, in order to distinguish
him from the son of the house, the word “Little”
was prefixed, and the latter, although he was really the
smaller of the two, was called, by way of distinction, Big
Hans. The most remarkable thing about Little Hans
was that he had, in spite of his youth, a very well-developed
beard. Big Hans, who had not a hair on his chin,
rather envied him this manly ornament. Then, again,
Little Hans was a capital fighter, and could knock you
down in one round with great coolness and sweet-tempered
seriousness, as if he were acting entirely from a
sense of duty. He never used any hard words; but the
moment his adversary attempted to rise, Little Hans quietly
gave him another knock, and winked wickedly at
him, as if warning him to lie still. He never bragged of
his victories, but showed a modest self-appreciation to
which very few of his age ever attain. Big Hans, who
valued his friend and namesake above others, and had a
hearty admiration for his many fine qualities, declared
himself utterly unable to rival him in combativeness,
modesty, and coolness of temper. For Big Hans, I am
sorry to say, was sometimes given to bragging of his
muscle and of his skill in turning hand-springs and standing
on his head, and he could easily be teased into a
furious temper. Now, Little Hans could not turn hand-springs,
nor could he stand on his head; but, though he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
promptly resented any trifling with his dignity, I never
once knew him to lose his temper. He never laughed
when anything struck him as being funny; in fact, he
seemed to regard every boisterous exhibition of feeling
as undignified. He only turned his head away and
stood chewing a piece of paper or a straw, with his usual
look of comical gravity in his eye.</p>

<p>Many people wondered at the fast friendship which
bound Big Hans and Little Hans together. Their tastes,
people said, were dissimilar; in temperament, too, they
had few points of resemblance. And yet they were absolutely
inseparable. Wherever Big Hans went, Little
Hans was sure to follow. Often they were seen racing
along the beach or climbing up the mountain-side; and,
as Little Hans was a capital hand (or ought I to say
foot?) at climbing, Big Hans often had hard work to
keep up with him. Sometimes Little Hans would leap
up a rock which was so steep that it was impossible for
his friend to climb it, and then he would grin comically
down at Big Hans, who would stand below calling tearfully
to his companion until he descended, which usually
was very soon. For Little Hans was very fond of Big
Hans, and could never bear to see him cry. And that is
not in the least to be wondered at, as Big Hans had
saved him from starvation and death when Little Hans
was really in the sorest need. Their acquaintance began
in the following manner: one day when Big Hans was
up in the mountains trapping hares, he heard a feeble
voice in a cleft of the rocks near by, and hurrying to the
spot, he found Little Hans wedged in between two great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
stones, and his leg caught in so distressing a manner that
it cost Big Hans nearly an hour’s work to set it free.
Then he dressed the bruised foot with a rag torn from
the lining of his coat, and carried Little Hans home in
his arms. And as Little Hans’ parents had never
claimed him, and he himself could give no satisfactory
account of them, he had thenceforth remained at Myrbraaten,
where all the children were very fond of him.
Turid, their mother, on the other hand, had no great
liking for him, especially after he had devoured her
hymn-book (which was her most precious property) and
eaten with much appetite a piece of Dolly’s dress. For,
as I intimated, Little Hans’ tastes were very curious,
and nothing came amiss when he was hungry. He had
a trick of pulling off Dolly’s stockings when she was sitting
out on the green, and if he were not discovered in
time, he was sure to make his breakfast off of them. With
these tastes, you will readily understand, Big Hans could
have no sympathy, and the only thing which could induce
him to forgive Little Hans’ eccentricities was the
fact that Little Hans was a goat.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>In the winter of 187&ndash;, a great deal of snow fell on the
northwestern coast of Norway. The old pines about the
Myrbraaten cottage were laden down with it; the children
had to be put to work with snow-shovels early in
the morning, in order to hollow out a tunnel to the cow-stable
where the cow stood bellowing with hunger. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
mother, too, worked bravely, and sometimes when the
thin roof of snow caved in and fell down upon them,
they laughed heartily, and their mother too, could
not help laughing because they were so happy. Little
Hans also made a pretence of working, but only succeeded
in being in everybody’s way, and when the
cold snow drizzled down upon his nose he grinned
and made faces so queer that the children shouted with
merriment.</p>

<p>Day after day, and week after week, the snow continued
to descend. Big Hans and his friend sat at the
window watching the large feathery flakes, as they whirled
slowly and silently through the air and covered the earth
far and near with a white pall. Soon there was a scarcity
of wood at the Myrbraaten cottage, and Halvor was obliged
to get into his skees and go to the forest. Humming
the multiplication table (so far as he knew it) to the tune
of a hymn, he pulled on his warmest jacket, took his axe
from its hiding-place under the eaves, and went in a
slanting line up the mountain-side; but before he had
gone many rods it struck him that it was useless to
go so far for wood, when the whole mountain-slope was
covered with pines. Fresh pine would be a little hard to
burn, to be sure, but then pine was full of pitch and
would burn anyhow. He therefore took off his skees,
dug a hole in the snow, and felled three or four trees only
a few hundred rods above the cottage. When his wife
heard the sound of his axe so near the house, she rushed
out and cried to him:</p>

<p>“Halvor, Halvor, don’t cut down the trees on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
slope! They are all that keep the snow from coming
down upon us in an avalanche, and sweeping us into the
ocean!”</p>

<p>“Oh, the Lord will look out for his own,” sang Halvor,
cheerily.</p>

<p>“The Lord put the pine-trees there to protect us,” replied
his wife.</p>

<p>But the end was that, in spite of his wife’s protests,
Halvor continued to fell the trees.</p>

<p>The heavy fall of snow was followed in the course of
a week by a sudden thaw.</p>

<p>Strange creaking and groaning sounds stole through
the forest. Sometimes when a large load of snow fell, it
rolled and grew as it rolled, until it dashed against a
huge trunk and nearly broke it with its weight.</p>

<p>Then, one night, there came down a great load which
fell with a dull thud and rolled down and down, pushing a
growing wall of snow before it, until it reached the clearing
where Halvor had cut his wood; there, meeting
with no obstructions, it gained a tremendous headway,
sweeping all the snow and the felled trunks with it, and
rushed down in a great mass, carrying along stones,
shrubs, huge trees, and the very soil itself, leaving nothing
but the bare rock behind it. How terrible was the
sight! A smoke-like cloud rose in the darkness, and a
sound as of a thousand thundering cataracts filled the night.
On it swept, onward, with a wild, resistless speed! At
the jutting rock, where the juniper stood, the avalanche
divided, tearing up the old spruces and the birches by
the roots and hurling them down, but leaving the juniper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
standing alone on its barren peak. It was but a moment’s
work. The avalanche shot downward with increased
speed&mdash;hark!&mdash;a sharp shriek, a smothered groan, then
a fierce hissing sound of waves that rose toward the sky
and returned with a long thundering cannonade to the
strand! The night was darker and the silence deeper
than before.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Where the Myrbraaten cottage had stood, the bare
rock now stares black and dismal against the sun. The
rumor of the calamity spread like wild-fire through the
valley, and the folk of the whole parish came to gaze
upon the ruin which the avalanche had wrought. All
that was left of Myrbraaten was the cow-stable, where
the cow and Little Hans and Big Hans had slept. Little
Hans had been very ill-behaved the night before, so
Turid had sent him to sleep with the cow; and Big
Hans, who thought it would be cruel to ask his companion
to spend the night in that dark stable, with only a
cow for company, had gone with him and slept with him
in the hay. Thus it happened that Little Hans and Big
Hans both were saved. It was pitiful to see them shivering
in the wet snow. Big Hans was crying as if his
heart would break; and the women who crowded about
him were unable to comfort him. What should he, a
small boy of ten, do alone in this wide world? His
father and his mother and his little brothers and sisters
were all gone, and there was no one left who cared for
him. Just then Little Hans, who was anxious to express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
his sympathy, put his nose close to Big Hans’ face and
rubbed it against his cheek.</p>

<p>“Yes, you are right, Little Hans,” sobbed the boy,
embracing his faithful friend; “you do care for me.
You are the only one I have left now, in all the world.
You and I will stand by each other always.”</p>

<p>Little Hans then said, “Ma-a-a,” which in his language
meant, “Yes.”</p>

<p>The question soon arose in the parish&mdash;what was to
be done with Big Hans? He had no relatives except a
brother of his mother, who had emigrated many years
before to Minnesota; and there was no one else who
seemed disposed to assume the burden of his support.
It was finally decided that he should be hired out as a
pauper to the lowest bidder, and that the parish should
pay for his board. But when the people who bid for
him refused to take Little Hans too, the boy determined,
after some altercation with the authorities, to
seek his uncle in America. One thing he was sure of,
and that was that he would not part from Little Hans.
But there was no one in the parish who would board
Little Hans without extra pay. Accordingly, the cow
and the barn were sold for the boy’s benefit, and he and
his comrade went on foot to the city, where they bought
a ticket for New York.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that Big Hans and Little Hans became
Americans. But before they reached the United
States some rather curious things happened to them.
The captain of the steamship, Big Hans found, was not
willing to take a goat as a passenger, and Big Hans was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
forced to return with his friend to the pier, while the
other emigrants thronged on board. He was nearly at
his wits’ end, when it suddenly occurred to him to put
Little Hans in a bag and smuggle him on board as baggage.
This was a lucky thought. Little Hans was
quite heavy, to be sure, but he seemed to comprehend
the situation perfectly, and kept as still as a mouse in
his bag while Big Hans, with the assistance of a benevolent
fellow-passenger, lugged him up the gang-plank.
And when he emerged from his retirement some time
after the steamer was well under way, none of the officers
even thought of throwing the poor goat overboard; for
Little Hans became a great favorite with both crew and
passengers, although he played various mischievous
pranks, in his quiet, unostentatious way, and ate some
shirts which had been hung out to dry.</p>

<p>It was early in April when the two friends arrived in
New York. They attracted considerable attention as
they walked up Broadway together; and many people
turned around to laugh at the little emigrant boy, in his
queer Norwegian costume, who led a full-grown goat
after him by a halter. The bootblacks and the newsboys
pointed their fingers at them, and, when that had no
effect, made faces at them, and pulled Big Hans by his
short jacket and Little Hans by his short tail. Big Hans
was quite frightened when he saw how many of them
there were, but, perceiving that Little Hans was not in
the least ruffled, he felt ashamed of himself, and took
heart again. Thus they marched on for several blocks,
while the crowd behind them grew more and more bois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>terous
and importunate. Suddenly, one big boy, who
seemed to be the leader of the gang, sprang forward with
a yell and knocked off Big Hans’ hat, while all the rest
cheered loudly; but just as he was turning around to
enjoy his triumph, Little Hans turned around too, and
gave him a bump from behind which sent him headlong
into the gutter. Then, rising on his hind legs, Little
Hans leaped forward again and again, and despatched the
second and third boy in the same manner, whereupon all
the rest ran away, helter-skelter, scattering through the
side streets. It was all done in so quiet and gentlemanly
a manner that not one of the grown-up spectators who
had gathered on the sidewalk thought of interfering.
Big Hans, however, who had intended to see something
of the city before starting for the West, was so discouraged
at the inhospitable reception the United States
had given him, that he gave up his purpose, and returned
disconsolately to Castle Garden. There he spent the
rest of the day, and when the night came, he went to
sleep on the floor, with his little bundle under his head;
while Little Hans, who did not seem to be sleepy, lay
down at his side, quietly munching a piece of pie which
he had stolen from somebody’s luncheon-basket.</p>

<p>Early the next morning Big Hans was awakened by a
gentle pulling at his coat-collar; and, looking up, he saw
that it was Little Hans. He jumped up as quickly as
he could, and he found that it was high time, for all the
emigrants had formed into a sort of a procession and
were filing through the gate on their way to the railway
station. There were some seven or eight hundred of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
them&mdash;toil-worn, sad-faced men and women, and queer-looking
children in all sorts of outlandish costumes. Big
Hans and his friend ran to take their places at the very
end of the procession, and just managed to slip through
the gate before it was closed. At the railway station the
boy exhibited his ticket which he had bought at the
steamship office in Norway, and was just about to board
the train, when the conductor cried out:</p>

<p>“Hold on, there! This is not a cattle-train! You
can’t take your goat into the passenger-car!”</p>

<p>Big Hans did not quite comprehend what was said, but
from the expression of the conductor’s voice and face, he
surmised that there was some objection to his comrade.</p>

<p>“I think I have money enough to buy a ticket for
Little Hans, too,” he said, in his innocent Norwegian
way, as he pulled a five-dollar bill from his pocket.</p>

<p>“I don’t want your money,” cried the conductor, who
knew as little of Norwegian as Big Hans did of English.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way there with your billy-goat!”</p>

<p>And he hustled the boy roughly out of the way to
make room for the other emigrants, who were thronging
up to the platform.</p>

<p>“Well, then,” said Big Hans, “since they don’t want
us on the train, Little Hans, we shall have to walk to
Minnesota. And as this railroad is going that way, I
suppose we shall get there if we follow the track.”</p>

<p>Little Hans seemed to think that this was a good
plan; for, as soon as the train had steamed off, he started
at a brisk rate along the track, so that his master had
great difficulty in keeping up with him. For several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
hours they trudged along cheerfully, and both were in
excellent spirits. Minnesota, Big Hans supposed, might,
perhaps, be a day’s journey off, and if he walked fast he
thought he would probably be there at nightfall. When
once he was there, he did not doubt but that everybody
would know his Uncle Peter. He was somewhat puzzled,
however, when he came to a place where no less
than three railroad tracks branched off in different directions;
and, as there was no one to ask, he sat down patiently
in the shade of a tree and determined to wait.
Presently a man came along with a red flag.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you would kindly tell me if this is the way
to Minnesota,” said Big Hans, taking off his cap and
bowing politely to the man.</p>

<p>The man shook his head sullenly, but did not answer;
he did not understand the boy’s language.</p>

<p>“And you don’t happen to know my uncle, Peter
Volden?” essayed the boy, less confidently, making another
respectful bow to the flagman.</p>

<p>“You are a queer loon of a chap,” grumbled the man;
“but if you don’t jump off the track with your goat, the
train will run over both of you.”</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken, when the train was seen rounding
the curve, and the boy had just time to pull Little
Hans over into the ditch when the locomotive came
thundering along, sending out volumes of black smoke,
which scattered slowly in the warm air, making the sunlight
for awhile seem gray and dingy. Big Hans was almost
stunned, but picked himself up, with a little fainter
heart than before, perhaps; but whispering a snatch of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
prayer which his mother had taught him, he seized Little
Hans by the halter, and started once more upon his
weary way after the train.</p>

<p>“Minnesota must be a great way off, I am afraid,” he
said, addressing himself, as was his wont, to his companion;
“but if we keep on walking, it seems to me we
must, in the end, get there; or, what do you think, Little
Hans?”</p>

<p>Little Hans did not choose to say what he thought,
just then, for his attention had been called to some tender
grass at the roadside which he knew tasted very
sweet. Big Hans was then reminded that he, too, was
hungry, and he sat down on a stone and ate a piece of
bread which he had brought with him from Castle Garden.
The sun rose higher in the sky and the heat grew
more and more oppressive. Still the emigrant boy
trudged on patiently. Whenever he came to a station
he stopped, and read the sign, and shook his head sadly
when he saw some unfamiliar name.</p>

<p>“Not Minnesota yet, Little Hans,” he sighed; “I am
afraid we shall have to take lodgings somewhere for the
night. I am so footsore and tired.”</p>

<p>It was then about six o’clock in the evening, and the
two friends had walked about twenty miles. At the
next station they met a hand-organ man, who was sitting
on a truck, feeding his monkey.</p>

<p>Big Hans, who had never seen so funny an animal before,
was greatly delighted. He went close up to the
man, and put out his hand cautiously to touch the monkey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“Are you going to Minnesota, too?” he asked, in a
tone of great friendliness; “if so, we might bear each
other company. I like that hairy little fellow of yours
very much.”</p>

<p>The hand-organ man, who, like most men of his calling,
was an Italian, shook his head, and the monkey
shook his head, too, as if to say, “All that may be very
fine, but I don’t understand it.”</p>

<p>The boy, however, was too full of delight to notice
whether he was understood or not; and when the monkey
took off his little red hat and offered to shake hands
with him, he laughed until the tears rolled down his
cheeks. He seemed to have entirely forgotten Little
Hans, who was standing by, glowering at the monkey
with a look which was by no means friendly. The fact
was, Little Hans had never been accustomed to any rival
in his master’s affection, and he didn’t enjoy in the least
the latter’s interest in the monkey. He kept his jealousy
to himself, however, as long as he could; but when
Big Hans, after having giving ten cents to the organ-man,
took the monkey on his lap and patted and stroked
it, Little Hans’ heart was ready to burst. He could not
endure seeing his affections so cruelly trifled with.
Bending his head and rising on his hind legs, he darted
forward and gave his rival a knock on the head that sent
him tumbling in a heap at Big Hans’ feet. The Italian
jumped up with a terrible shout and seized his treasure
in his arms. The monkey made an effort to open its
eyes, gave a little shiver, and&mdash;was dead. The boy
stood staring in mute despair at the tiny stiffened body;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
he felt like a murderer. Hardly knowing what he did,
he seized Little Hans’ halter; but in the same moment
the enraged owner of the monkey rushed at the goat
with the butt end of his whip uplifted. Little Hans,
who was dauntless as ever, dexterously dodged the blow,
but the instant his antagonist had turned to vent his
wrath upon his master, he gave him an impetus from behind
which sent him headlong out upon the railroad
track. A crowd of men and boys (of the class who always
lounge about railroad stations) had now collected
to see the fight, and goaded both combatants on with
their jeering cries. The Italian, who was maddened with
anger, had just picked himself up, and was plunging forward
for a second attack upon Little Hans, when Big
Hans, seeing the danger, flung himself over his friend’s
back, clasping his arms about his neck. The loaded end
of the whip struck Big Hans in the back of the head;
without a sound, the boy fell senseless upon the track.</p>

<p>Then a policeman arrived, and Little Hans, the Italian,
and the insensible boy were taken to the police-station.
A doctor was summoned, and he declared that
Big Hans’ wound was very dangerous, and that he must
be taken to the hospital. And there the emigrant boy
lay for six weeks, hovering between life and death; but
when, at the end of that time, he was permitted to go
out, he heard with dread that he was to testify at the
Italian’s trial. A Norwegian interpreter was easily
found, and when Hans told his simple story to the judge,
there were many wet eyes in the court-room. And he
himself cried, too, for he thought that Little Hans was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
lost. But just as he had finished his story, he heard a
loud “Ba-a-a” in his ear; he jumped down from the
witness-stand and flung his arms about Little Hans’
neck and laughed and cried as if he had lost his wits.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that such a scene had never before
been witnessed in an American court-room.</p>

<p>The next day Big Hans and Little Hans were both
sent by rail, at the expense of some kind-hearted citizens,
to their uncle in Minnesota. And it was there I
made their acquaintance.</p>

<h2><a name="A_NEW_WINTER_SPORT" id="A_NEW_WINTER_SPORT"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">A NEW WINTER SPORT.</a></h2>


<p>It is a curious fact that so useful an article as the
Norwegian <em>skees</em> has not been more generally introduced
in the United States. In some of the Western States,
notably in Wisconsin and Minnesota, where the Scandinavian
population is large, the immigrants of Norse
blood are beginning to teach Americans the use of their
national snow-shoes, and in Canada there has been an
attempt made (with what success I do not know) to
make skee-running popular. But the subject has by no
means received the consideration which it deserves, and
I am confident that I shall earn the gratitude of the
great army of boys if I can teach them how to enjoy
this fascinating sport.</p>

<p>Let me first, then, describe a <em>skee</em> and tell you how to
have it made. You take a piece of tough, straight-grained
pine, from five to ten feet long, and cut it down
until it is about the breadth of your foot, or, at most,
an inch broader. There must be no knots in the wood,
and the grain must run with tolerable regularity lengthwise
from end to end.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_166-250.jpg" width="250" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Bending the Skee.</div>
</div>

<p>If you cannot find a piece without a knot, then let the
knot be as near the hind end as possible; but such a <em>skee</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
is not perfect, as it is apt to break if subjected to the
strain of a “jump” or a “hollow” in a swift run. The
thickness of the <em>skee</em> should be about an inch or an inch
and one-half in the middle, and it should gradually grow
thinner toward each end. Cut the forward end into a
point&mdash;not abruptly, but with a gradual curve, as shown
in the drawings. Pierce the middle latitudinally with
a hole, about half an inch in height and an inch or
(if required) more in width; then bend the forward
pointed end by means of five sticks, placed as the drawing
indicates, and let the <em>skee</em> remain in this position for
four or five days, until
its bend has become
permanent, and
it will no longer, on
the removal of the
sticks, resume the
straight line. Before
doing this, however,
it would be well to plane the under side of the <em>skee</em> carefully
and then polish and sand-paper it, until it is as
smooth as a mirror. It is, of course, of prime importance
to diminish as much as possible the friction in running and
to make the <em>skee</em> glide easily over the surface of the snow,
and the Norwegians use for this purpose soft-soap, which
they rub upon the under side of the <em>skee</em>, and which, I
am told, has also a tendency to make the wood tougher.
In fact, too much care cannot be exercised in this respect,
as the excellence of the <em>skees</em>, when finished, depends
primarily upon the combined toughness and light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>ness
of the wood. Common pine will not do; for although,
when well seasoned, it is light
enough, it is rarely strong enough to
bear the required strain. The tree
known to Norwegians as the fir (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sylvestris
pinus</i>), which has long, flexible needles,
hanging in tassels (not evenly distributed
along the branch, as in the spruce), is most
commonly used, as it is tough and pitchy,
but becomes light in weight, without losing
its strength, when it is well seasoned
and dried. Any other strong and straight-grained
wood might, perhaps, be used, but
would, I think, be liable to the objection
of being too heavy.</p>

<div class="caption">

</div>

<p>When the <em>skee</em> has been prepared as
above described, there only remains to put
a double band through the middle; the
Norwegians make it of twisted withes, and
fit its size to the toe of the boot. If the
band is too wide, so as to reach up on the
instep, it is impossible to steer the <em>skee</em>,
while if it is too narrow the foot is apt to
slip out. Of these two withe-bands, one
should stand up and the other lie down
horizontally, so as to steady the foot and
prevent it from sliding. A little knob,
just in front of the heel, might serve a
similar purpose. Leather, or any other
substance which is apt to stretch when getting wet, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
not do for bands, although undoubtedly something
might be contrived which might be even preferable to
withes. I am only describing the <em>skees</em> as they are
used in Norway&mdash;not as they might be improved in
America. In the West, I am told, a good substitute
for the withe-band has been found in a kind of leather
cap resembling the toe of a boot. As I have never
myself tried this, I dare not express an opinion about
its practicability; but as it is of the utmost importance
that the runner should be able to free his foot easily, I
would advise every boy who tries this cap to make perfectly
sure that it does not prevent him from ridding
himself of the <em>skee</em> at a moment’s notice. The chief difficulty
that the beginner has to encounter is the tendency
of the <em>skees</em> to “spread,” and the only thing for him to
do in such a case, provided he is running too fast to
trust to his ability to get them parallel again, is to jump
out of the bands and let the <em>skees</em> go. Let him take care
to throw himself backward, breaking his fall by means of
the staff, and in the soft snow he will sustain no injury.
Whenever an accident occurs in skee-running, it can usually
be traced to undue tightness of the band, which may
make it difficult to withdraw the feet instantly. A pair
of <em>skees</em> kept at the rooms of the American Geographical
Society, New York, are provided with a safeguard against
“spreading” in the shape of a slight groove running
longitudinally along the under side of each <em>skee</em>. I have
seen <em>skees</em> provided with two such grooves, each about an
inch from the edge and meeting near the forward point.</p>

<p>There has, of course, to be one <em>skee</em> for each foot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the second is an exact duplicate of the first. The upper
sides of both are usually decorated, either in colors or
with rude carvings; the forward ends are usually painted
for about a foot, either in black or red.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="caption">
Staff with a Wheel that Acts as a Brake</div>
</div>

<p>Now, the reader will ask: “What advantage does this
kind of snow-shoes offer over the ordinary Indian ones,
which are in common use in the Western and Northern
States?” Having tried both, I think I may confidently
answer that the <em>skees</em> are superior, both in speed and convenience;
and, moreover, they effect a great saving of
strength. The force which, with the American snow-shoes,
is expended in lifting the feet, is with the <em>skees</em>
applied only as a propeller, for the <em>skee</em> glides, and is
never lifted; and on level ground the resistance of the
body in motion impels the skee-runner with each forward
stride several feet beyond the length of his step.
If he is going down-hill, his effort will naturally be to
diminish rather than to increase his speed, and he carries
for this purpose a strong but light staff about six feet
long, upon which he may lean more or less heavily, and
thereby retard the rapidity of his progress. The best
skee-runners, however, take great pride in dispensing
with the staff, and one often sees them in Norway rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>ing
down the steepest hill-sides with incredible speed,
with a whirling cloud of snow following in their track.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_170a.jpg" width="200" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
Side View, showing Foot in Position.</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Although this may be a
very fine and inspiriting
sight, I should not recommend
beginners to be
too hasty in throwing
away the staff, as it is
only by means of it that they are able to guide their
course down over the snowy slope, just as a ship is
steered by its rudder. If you wish to steer toward the
right, you press your staff down into the snow on your
right side, while a similar manœuvre on your left side
will bend your course in that direction. If you wish to
test your <em>skees</em> when they are finished, put your feet into
the bands, and let someone take hold of the two front
ends and slowly raise them while you are standing in
the bands. If they bear your weight, they are regarded
as safe, and will not be likely to break in critical moments.
In conclusion, let me add that the length and
thickness of the <em>skees</em>, as here described, are not invariable,
but must vary in accordance with the size of the
boy who wishes to
use them. Five
feet is regarded as
the minimum
length, and would
suit a boy from
twelve to fourteen years old, while a grown-up man
might safely make them twice that length.</p>

</div>

<p>In Norway, where the woods are pathless in winter,
and where heavy snows continually fall from the middle
of October until the middle of April, it is easily seen
how essential, nay indispensable, the <em>skees</em> must be to
hunters, trappers, and lumber-men, who have to depend
upon the forests for their livelihood. Therefore, one of
the first accomplishments which the Norwegian boy
learns, as soon as he is old enough to find his way
through the parish alone, is the use of these national
snow-shoes. If he wakes up one fine winter morning
and sees the huge snow-banks blockading doors and windows,
and a white, glittering surface extending for miles
as far as his eye can reach, he gives a shout of delight,
buttons his thick woollen jacket up to his chin, pulls the
fur borders of his cap down over his ears, and then, having
cleared a narrow path between the dwelling-house
and the cow-stables, makes haste to jump into his <em>skees</em>.
If it is cold (as it usually is) and the snow accordingly dry
and crisp, he knows that it will be a splendid day for
skee-running. If, on the contrary, the snow is wet and
heavy, it is apt to stick in clots to the <em>skees</em>, and then the
sport is attended with difficulties which are apt to spoil
the amusement. We will take it for granted, however,
that there are no indications of a thaw, and we will accompany
the Norse boy on his excursions over the
snowy fields and through the dense pine-woods, in which
he and his father spend their days in toil, not untempered
with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Now, quick, Ola, my lad!” cries his father to him;
“fetch the axe from the wood-shed and bring me my gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
from the corner behind the clock, and we will see what
luck we have had with the fox-traps and the snares up in
the birch-glen.”</p>

<p>And Ola has no need of being asked twice to attend to
such duties. His mother, in the meanwhile, has put up
a luncheon, consisting of cold smoked ham and bread and
butter, in a gayly painted wooden box, which Ola slings
across his shoulder, while Nils, his father, sticks the axe
into his girdle, and with his gun in one hand and his
skee-staff in the other, emerges into the bright winter
morning. They then climb up the steep snow-banks,
place their <em>skees</em> upon the level surface, and put their
feet into the bands. Nils gives a tremendous push with
his staff and away he flies down the steep hill-side, while
his little son, following close behind him, gives an Indian
war-whoop, and swings his staff about his head to show
how little he needs it. Whew, how fast he goes! How
the cold wind sings in his ears; how the snow whirls
about him, filling his eyes and ears and silvering the loose
locks about his temples, until he looks like a hoary little
gnome who has just stepped out from the mountain-side!
But he is well used to snow and cold, and he does not
mind it a bit.</p>

<p>In a few seconds father and son have reached the bottom
of the valley, and before them is a steep incline,
overgrown with leafless birch and elder forests. It is
there where they have their snares, made of braided
horse-hair; and as bait they use the red berries of the
mountain ash, of which ptarmigan and thrushes are very
fond. Now comes the test of their strength; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
snow is too deep and loose to wade through, and to climb
a declivity on <em>skees</em> is by no means as easy as it is to slide
down a smooth hill-side. They now have to plod along
slowly, ascending in long zig-zag lines, pausing often to
rest on their staves, and to wipe the perspiration from
their foreheads. Half an hour’s climb brings them to the
trapping-grounds. But there, indeed, their efforts are
well rewarded.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, look, father!” cries the boy, ecstatically.
“Oh, what a lot we have caught! Why, there are three
dozen birds, as sure as there is one.”</p>

<p>His father smiles contentedly, but says nothing. He
is too old a trapper to give way to his delight.</p>

<p>“There is enough to buy you a new coat for Christmas,
lad,” he says, chuckling; “and if we make many more
such hauls, we may get enough to buy mother a silver
brooch, too, to wear at church on Sundays.”</p>

<p>“No, buy mother’s brooch first, father,” protests the
lad, a little hesitatingly (for it costs many boys an effort
to be generous); “my coat will come along soon enough.
Although, to be sure, my old one is pretty shabby,” he
adds, with a regretful glance at his patched sleeves.</p>

<p>“Well, we will see, we will see,” responds Nils, pulling
off his bear-skin mittens and gliding in among the
trees in which the traps are set. “The good Lord, who
looks after the poor man as well as the rich, may send us
enough to attend to the wants of us all.”</p>

<p>He had opened his hunting-bag, and was loosening the
snare from the neck of a poor strangled ptarmigan, when
all of a sudden he heard a great flapping of wings, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
glancing down through the long colonnade of frost-silvered
trees, saw a bird which had been caught by the leg,
and was struggling desperately to escape from the snare.</p>

<p>“Poor silly thing!” he said, half-pityingly; “it is not
worth a shot. Run down and dispatch it, Ola.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t like to kill things, father,” cried the lad,
who with a fascinated gaze was regarding the struggling
ptarmigan. “When they hang themselves I don’t mind
it so much; but it seems too wicked to wring the neck of
that white, harmless bird. No, let me cut the snare with
my knife and let it go.”</p>

<p>“All right; do as you like, lad,” answered the father,
with gruff kindliness.</p>

<p>And with a delight which did his heart more honor
than his head, Ola slid away on his <em>skees</em> toward the
struggling bird, which, the moment he touched it, hung
perfectly still, with its tongue stuck out, as if waiting for
its death-blow.</p>

<p>“Kill me,” it seemed to say. “I am quite ready.”</p>

<p>But, instead of killing it, Ola took it gently in his
hand, and stroked it caressingly while cutting the snare
and disentangling its feet. How wildly its little heart
beat with fright! And the moment his hold was relaxed,
down it tumbled into the snow, ran a few steps,
then took to its wings, dashed against a tree in sheer bewilderment,
and shook down a shower of fine snow on
its deliverer’s head. Ola felt quite heroic when he saw
the bird’s delight, and thought how, perhaps, next summer
(when it had changed its coat to brown) it would
tell its little ones, nestling under its wings, of its hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>breadth
escape from death, and of the kind-hearted
youngster who had set it free instead of killing it.</p>

<p>While Ola was absorbed in these pleasant reflections,
Nils, his father, had filled his hunting-bag with game and
was counting his spoils.</p>

<p>“Now, quick, laddie,” he called out, cheerily. “Stir
your stumps and bring me your bag of bait. Get the
snares to rights and fix the berries, as you have seen me
doing.”</p>

<p>Ola was very fond of this kind of work, and he pushed
himself with his staff from tree to tree, and hung the
tempting red berries in the little hoops and arches which
were attached to the bark of the trees. He was in the
midst of this labor, when suddenly he heard the report
of his father’s gun, and, looking up, saw a fox making a
great leap, then plunging headlong into the snow.</p>

<p>“Hello, Mr. Reynard,” remarked Nils, as he slid over
toward the dead animal. “You overslept yourself this
morning. You have stolen my game so long, now, that
it was time I should get even with you. And yet, if the
wind had been the other way, you would have caught
the scent of me sooner than I should have caught yours.
Now, sir, we are quits.”</p>

<p>“What a great, big, sleek fellow!” ejaculated Ola,
stroking the fox’s fur and opening his mouth to examine
his sharp, needle-pointed teeth.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nils; “I have saved the rascal the
trouble of hunting until he has grown fat and secure,
and fond of his ease. I had a long score to settle with
that old miscreant, who has been robbing my snares ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
since last season. His skin is worth about three dollars.”</p>

<p>When the task of setting the snares in order had been
completed, father and son glided lightly away under the
huge, snow-laden trees to visit their traps, which were
set further up the mountain. The sun was just peeping
above the mountain-ridge, and the trees and the great
snow-fields flashed and shone, as if oversown with numberless
diamonds. Round about were the tracks of birds
and beasts; the record of their little lives was traced
there in the soft, downy snow, and could be read by
everyone who had the eyes to read. Here were the
tracks telling of the quiet pottering of the leman and the
field-mouse, going in search of their stored provisions for
breakfast, but rising to take a peep at the sun on the
way. You could trace their long, translucent tunnels
under the snow-crust, crossing each other in labyrinthine
entanglements. Here Mr. Reynard’s graceful tail had
lightly brushed over the snow, as he leaped to catch
young Mrs. Partridge, who had just come out to scratch
up her breakfast of frozen huckleberries, and here Mr.
and Mrs. Squirrel (a very estimable couple) had partaken
of their frugal repast of pine-cone seeds, the remains of
which were still scattered on the snow. But far prettier
were the imprints of their tiny feet, showing how they
sat on their haunches, chattering amicably about the high
cost of living, and of that grasping monopolist, Mr. Reynard,
who had it all his own way in the woods, and had
no more regard for life than a railroad president. This
and much more, which I have not the time to tell you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
did Ola and his father observe on their skee-excursion
through the woods. And when, late in the afternoon,
they turned their faces homeward, they had, besides the
ptarmigan and the fox, a big capercailzie (or grouse)
cock, and two hares. The twilight was already falling,
for in the Norway winter it grows dark early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Now, let us see, lad,” said Ola’s father, regarding his
son with a strange, dubious glance, “if you have got
Norse blood in your veins. We don’t want to go home
the way we came, or we should scarcely reach the house
before midnight. But if you dare risk your neck with
your father, we will take the western track down the bare
mountain-side. It takes brisk and stout legs to stand in
that track, my lad, and I won’t urge you, if you are afraid.”</p>

<p>“I guess I can go where you can, father,” retorted the
boy, proudly. “Anyway, my neck isn’t half so valuable
as yours.”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a man!” said the father, in a voice of
deep satisfaction. “Now for it, lad! Make yourself
ready. Strap the hunting-bag close under your girdle, or
you will lose it. Test your staff to make sure that it will
hold, for if it breaks you are gone. Be sure you don’t
take my track. You are a fine chap and a brave one.”</p>

<p>Ola followed his father’s directions closely, and stood
with loudly palpitating heart ready for the start. Before
him lay the long, smooth slope of the mountain, showing
only here and there soft undulations of surface, where
a log or a fence lay deeply buried under the snow. On
both sides the black pine-forest stood, tall and grave. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
he should miss his footing, or his <em>skees</em> be crossed or run
apart, very likely he might just as well order his epitaph.
If it had not been his father who had challenged him,
he would have much preferred to take the circuitous route
down into the valley. But now he was in for it, and
there was no time for retreating.</p>

<p>“Ready!” shouted Nils, advancing toward the edge
of the slope: “One, two, three!”</p>

<p>And like an arrow he shot down over the steep track,
guiding his course steadily with his staff; but it was
scarcely five seconds before he was lost to sight, looking
more like a whirling snow-drift than a man. With
strained eyes and bated breath, Ola stood looking after
him. Then, nerving himself for the feat, he glanced at
his <em>skees</em> to see that they were parallel, and glided out
over the terrible declivity. His first feeling was that he
had slid right out into the air&mdash;that he was rushing with
seven-league boots over forests and mountain-tops. For
all that, he did not lose hold of his staff, which he pressed
with all his might into the snow behind him, thus slightly
retarding his furious speed. Now the pine-trees seemed
to be running past him in a mad race up the mountain-side,
and the snowy slope seemed to be rising to meet
him, or moving in billowy lines under his feet. Gradually
he gathered confidence in himself, a sort of fierce
courage awoke within him, and a wild exultation surged
through his veins and swept him on. The wind whistled
about him and stung his face like whip-lashes. Now
he darted away over a snowed-up fence or wood-pile,
shooting out into the air, but always coming down firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
on his feet, and keeping his mind on his <em>skees</em>, so as
to prevent them from diverging or crossing. He had a
feeling of grandeur and triumphant achievement which
he had never experienced before. The world lay at his
feet, and he seemed to be striding over it in a march of
conquest. It was glorious! But all such sensations are
unhappily brief. Ola soon knew by his slackening speed
that he had reached the level ground; yet so great was
the impetus he had received that he flew up the opposite
slope toward his father’s farm, and only stopped some
fifty feet below the barn. He then rubbed his face and
pinched his nose, just to see whether it was frozen. The
muscles in his limbs ached, and the arm which had held
the staff was so stiff and cramped that the slightest movement
gave him pain. Nevertheless, he could not make
up his mind to rest; he saw the light put in the north
window to guide him, and he caught a glimpse of a pale,
anxious face behind the window-pane, and knew that it
was his mother who was waiting for him. And yet those
last fifty feet seemed miles to his tired and aching legs.
When he reached the front door, his dog Yutul jumped
up on him in his joy and knocked him flat down in the
snow; and oh, what an effort it took to rise! But no
sooner had he regained his feet, than he felt a pair of
arms flung about his neck and he sank, half laughing,
half crying, into his mother’s embrace.</p>

<p>“Cheer up, laddie,” he heard someone saying. “Ye
are a fine chap and a brave one!”</p>

<p>He knew his father’s voice; but he did not look up; he
was yet child enough to feel happiest in his mother’s arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most popular winter sports in Norway is
skee-racing. A steep hill is selected by the committee
which is to have charge of the race, and all the best skee-runners
in the district enter their names, eager to engage
in the contest. The track is cleared of all accidental obstructions,
but if there happens to be a stone or wooden
fence crossing it, the snow is dug away on the lower
side of it and piled up above it. The object is to obtain
what is called a “jump.” The skee-runner, of course,
coming at full speed down the slope will slide out over
this “jump,” shooting right out into the air and coming
down either on his feet or any other convenient portion
of his anatomy, as the case may be. To keep one’s footing,
and particularly to prevent the <em>skees</em> from becoming
crossed while in the air, are the most difficult feats connected
with skee-racing; and it is no unusual thing to
see even an excellent skee-runner plunging headlong into
the snow, while his <em>skees</em> pursue an independent race
down the track and tell the spectators of his failure.
Properly speaking, a skee-race is not a race&mdash;not a test
of speed, but a test of skill; for two runners rarely start
simultaneously, as, in case one of them should fall, the
other could not possibly stop, and might not even have
the time to change his course. He would thus be in
danger of running into his competitor, and could hardly
avoid maiming him seriously. If there were several parallel
tracks, at a distance of twenty to thirty feet from
each other, there would, of course, be less risk in having
the runners start together. Usually, a number fall in the
first run, and those who have not fallen then continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the contest until one gains the palm. If, as occasionally
happens, the competition is narrowed down to two, who
are about evenly matched, a proposal to run without
staves is apt to result in a decisive victory for one or the
other.</p>

<p>It can hardly be conceived how exciting these contests
are, not only to the skee-runners themselves, but also
to the spectators, male and female, who gather in groups
along the track and cheer their friends as they pass, waving
their handkerchiefs, and greeting with derisive cries
the mishaps which are inseparable from the sport. Prizes
are offered, such as rifles, watches, fine shooting equipments,
etc., and in almost every valley in the interior of
Norway there are skee-runners who, in consequence of
this constant competition, have attained a skill which
would seem almost incredible. As there are but two
things essential to a skee-race, viz.: a hill and snow, I
can see no reason why the sport should not in time become
as popular in the United States as it is in Norway.
We have snow enough, certainly, in the New England
and Western States; neither are hills rare phenomena.
If I should succeed in interesting any large number of
boys in these States in skee-running, I should feel that
I had conferred a benefit upon them, and added much to
their enjoyment of winter. But before taking leave of
them, let me give them two pieces of parting advice: 1.
Be sure your staff is strong, and do not be hasty in throwing
it away. 2. Never slide down a hill on a highway,
or any hard, icy surface. It is only in the open fields
and woods and in dry snow that <em>skees</em> are useful.</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>People live even within the Polar Circle, although
grown-up folks are apt to think it a poor sort of life.
But to boys the “land of the midnight sun” is a veritable
paradise. Every season of the year has its own kind
of sport; and as schoolmasters are rare birds so far north,
the boys are to a great extent left to follow their own
devices until they are old enough to be sent away to
school in the cities. From morning till night the air is
filled with a screaming host of birds, which whirl in
through the fiords like an approaching snow-storm. The
eider-ducks lie gently bobbing upon the water, the black
surf-scoters dive in the surf and make short work of the
young whiting, and the puffins sit in long soldier-like
rows on the rocks, and plunge headlong into the sea at
the first signal of danger. In this glorious region the fish
and fowl from all quarters of the globe seem to have appointed
an annual meeting about New Year’s; and the
Norwegian peasants, who are dependent upon the inhabitants
of the sea and the air for their living, are on the
lookout for them, and hasten to the coast to give them a
fitting reception.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry Winchester’s motive, however, for visiting the
Arctic wonderland was quite a different one. He had
made the acquaintance of the Birk boys during the previous
summer, and he had struck up a warm friendship
with one of them, named Magnus. His parents, who
lived in New York, had permitted him to accept the invitation
of Mr. Birk to spend the winter with his sons,
and Harry was so completely fascinated with the sports
and adventures which every day offered in abundance
that he would have liked to prolong his stay indefinitely.</p>

<p>Hasselrud, the estate of the Birks, was a fine, old-fashioned
mansion, which peeped out from the dense
foliage of chestnut and maple trees. Mr. Birk conducted
a large business in fish and lumber, and manned every
year several boats and sent them to the Lofoten fisheries.
His three sons, Olaf, Magnus, and Edwin, were brisk and
courageous lads, who had been accustomed to danger
from their earliest years, and could handle a gun and
manage a sail as well as any man in that region. Olaf
was nineteen years old, and wore the uniform of a midshipman
in the navy, and by courtesy was styled lieutenant;
Magnus, who was sixteen, was a fair-faced, curly-headed
lad, with frank blue eyes, a straight, handsome
nose, and a singular talent for getting into mischief.
Edwin was but twelve years old; but, as he does not
figure conspicuously in this narrative, there is no need of
describing him. But altogether the most important person
at Hasselrud, next to Mr. Birk, was Grim Hering-Luck,
a hoary, bow-legged fisherman, who was Mr. Birk’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
right-hand man and captain of his boat-guild. Grim had
a stern, deep-wrinkled face, framed in a wreath of grayish
whiskers. He had small, piercing eyes, and bushy,
gray-sprinkled hair. On his head he wore a sou’wester.
The seat and knees of his trousers and the elbows of his
coat were adorned with great shiny patches of leather.
The leathern girdle about his waist did not quite fulfil
its duties as suspenders, but allowed the trousers to slip
down on his hips, leaving some four inches of shirt visible
under the border of the waistcoat. Grim was a gruff old
customer, but it was commonly believed that his bark
was worse than his bite. He liked the bright American
boy better than he cared to confess, and therefore neglected
no opportunity for quarrelling with him. In fact,
everybody admired Harry’s enterprising spirit and was
entertained by his lively talk. Olaf was fairly dazzled
by his knowledge and experience of the world, and little
Edwin copied his walk and his picturesque recklessness
to the extent of his small ability; but among all the
family there was no one who was more ardently attached
to Harry than Magnus. The two were inseparable;
from morning till night they roamed about together,
setting traps for hares and ptarmigan, spearing trout in
the shallows of the river, trawling for mackerel in the
salt water, and sometimes tacking in and out of the fiord
in a furious gale. At such times, however, they were
sure to have Grim in the boat, and Grim was a capital
man to have in a boat in case of an emergency. Thus
they spent the beautiful autumn months until the November
storms began to blow, the snow began to fall, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the air, when they looked out the fiord, was thick and
the sky threatening. The great trees bent in agony and
howled in the blast with voices of despair. Then Grim
would begin to investigate and to mend the nets which
hung in long festoons along the walls of the boat-houses,
and, with his friendly grunt, he would say in reply to
Magnus’ queries:</p>

<p>“Wal, Mester Yallertop, the Lord he looks out fer
them as they look out fer themselves. He puts the cod
in the sea, but I never heared of his puttin’ it in yer
mouth fer ye. He made the land poor up here, but he
made the sea rich, jest fer to make the average right in
the end. He lets ye starve like a toothless rat if ye have
a taste fer starvin’. But thar ain’t no call for anybody to
starve here north, ef he can bait a hook and ain’t afeared
of bein’ late to his funeral.”</p>

<p>“Being late to your own funeral, Grim!” Magnus
would exclaim, in amazement; “how can a man be late
to his funeral?”</p>

<p>“Wal, now, Mester Yallertop, that I’ll tell ye. Fur
that ain’t no uncommon case here north. Suppose ye go
out in the mornin’ with the fishin’ fleet, and it blows up
right lively, and ye don’t never come back again. Then
after a week or so the parson reads the sarvice over yer
name and prays fer ye, and the next mornin’, likely as
not, yer legs drift ashore, quite independent-like, jest because
the cod found yer tarred top-boots indergestible.”</p>

<p>“And do such things ever happen, Grim?” the boy
would ask, shuddering at the ghastly picture which his
friend’s words suggested.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do they ever happen? Wal, I reckon they do. I
might jest mention to ye that I ain’t in the habit of
tellin’ no lies. My father&mdash;God ha’e mercy on his soul&mdash;he
sent only his legs fur to represent him at his funeral;
and my grandfather&mdash;wal, the cod turned the tables
on him; he had meant to eat them, but&mdash;it ain’t no use
bein’ squeamish about it&mdash;they ate him. It war in the
great storm of the 11th of February, 1848, when five
hundred fisherman cheated the parson out of his funeral
fees.”</p>

<p>“How terrible, Grim! How can you go to the fisheries
every winter, when both your father and your grandfather
lost their lives there?”</p>

<p>“Wal, now ye are puzzlin’ me, Mester Magnus,” Grim
replied, taking his clay pipe from the corner of his mouth,
and looking up seriously from his labor; “but I’ll tell
ye a yarn I heared when I was young. I reckon it is
true, because I have never heared nobody say it warn’t.
Some city chap axed a fisherman purty much what ye
have axed me, and the fisherman says, says he: ‘Whar
did yer father die?’ ‘Why, he expired peacefully in his
bed,’ said the city chap. ‘And yer grandfather?’ axed
the fisherman. ‘Wal, he had jest the same luck,’ says
the city chap. ‘And yer great-grandfather?’ ‘He, too,
turned up his toes in the same style.’ ‘Wal, now,’ says
the fisherman, ‘if I were you I wouldn’t never go to
bed again, sence all yer forbears come to their death in
it.’ Now, I reckon that is the way with all of us. Ef
the Lord wants us he will know whar to find us, wharsoever
we be.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Christmas holidays, with all their old-fashioned
hospitality and sports, were over the question was
seriously debated whether the boys should be permitted
to accompany Grim and the housemen (tenants) to the
Lofoten fisheries. It was decided that three boats
should be manned, and Grim was as usual elected captain
of the whole guild. The “tokens” had been uncommonly
good this year, and a profitable fishery was
expected. Mr. Birk, who well knew the dangers connected
with this enterprise, was very unwilling to let the
boys start out in the open boats, and suffer the discomforts
which were inseparable from the life on these barren
islands, where thousands of people were huddled together
in booths and shanties, and quarrels and fights
were the order of the day. Harry, however, argued that
such an experience would scarcely offer itself to him a
second time in his life, and that it was easy to avoid
danger while still observing all that was interesting and
instructive in the lives of the people. Olaf and Magnus,
too, added their powers of persuasion to those of Harry,
and in the end Mr. Birk (after enjoining a hundred precautions)
had to yield, stipulating only that Edwin
should remain at home. Grim promised to keep a careful
look-out over the movements of the boys, but he
refused to be responsible for their safety, because, as he
remarked, “they were too lively a lot to be controlled by
a stiff-legged old crab like himself.”</p>

<p>It was a gray morning in January that the long eight
oared boats were made ready, the chests containing provisions
and clothes were placed in the stern, and the sails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
with a rattling noise flew up and bulged before the wind.
The sky had a peculiar whitish-gray color, which has always
an ominous look and promises squalls. Yet it was
a glorious sensation to feel the boats shooting away over
the crests of the waves, dashing the spray like smoke
about them and yielding like living things to the slightest
prompting of the rudder. Grim himself sat in the
stern of the first boat, which the boys had named “The
Cormorant,” holding the tiller in his left hand and the
sheet in his right. Magnus had found a rather elevated
seat in the prow, from whence he could observe the captain’s
manœuvres and take lessons in seamanship. Harry
and Olaf sat on the middle bench, watching the horizon
and seeing the squalls dash down from the mountains
and sweep their trails of smoke across the fiord.</p>

<p>“It must be dangerous sailing here, Grim,” Harry observed,
uneasily.</p>

<p>“It ain’t no joke&mdash;fer goslings,” answered Grim.</p>

<p>“I should think, on the whole, it would be more comfortable
for goslings than for men,” retorted Harry, carelessly.
“They wouldn’t mind a ducking half as much
as I should.”</p>

<p>“If ye are afeard just say so, and I’ll put ye ashore,”
said Grim, sternly.</p>

<p>“Afraid!” said Harry, indignantly; “not much, old
man; guess I can give you odds any day if you want to
try my courage.”</p>

<p>“I want to try ef ye can hold your tongue,” was the
captain’s ungracious reply. “I ain’t much for gassin’ on
the water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Harry, thinking that perhaps the situation was graver
than he supposed, failed to resent the snub, and fell
again to watching the horizon. They shot away at a
tearing speed over the waves, and sometimes “The Cormorant”
careened heavily to leeward and shipped a sea,
but Grim still made no motion to reef the sail. The other
Hasselrud boats, which had kept bravely in the wake of
their leader, were now falling behind, and the blinding
spray often hid them completely from sight. The fiord
was growing wider, and the long “ground swell” showed
that they were nearing the ocean. The stormy petrel was
seen skimming lightly, half flying, half running, over the
tops of the billows, and her shrill scream pierced like a
sharp instrument through the deep bass of the wind. The
boats round about them multiplied, and a whole fleet of
reddish-brown sails was seen steering toward the Lofoten
Islands. The day passed without any incident, and when
about three o’clock in the afternoon the darkness came
rolling in like a gray curtain from the west, Grim put
into port and the boys devoured between them a five-pound
cod, whereupon they all crawled into the same
bunk in a fisherman’s lodging-house and slept the sleep
of the just.</p>

<p>The next morning they were aroused before daybreak,
and after a frugal repast of coffee and sandwiches were
hurried into the boat. The wide ocean now stretched
out before them, rolling with a mighty thundering
rhythm against the rock-bound coast. A light mist was
hovering over the water, but the wind was fair, and hundreds
of boats were already scudding northward toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
the rich fishing-banks. As soon as the fog rose and was
scattered, the invisible sun sent a faint semblance of light
up among the low clouds, and immediately thousands of
gulls and auks and cormorants were on the wing, and
whirled with a wild confusion of screams in the wake of
the fishing-fleet. When toward noon the wind slackened
a little, Magnus swung out a trawling-line and had almost
in the same moment a bite which sent the line
whizzing over the gunwale.</p>

<p>“Gracious! I am afraid I have caught a whale,” he
shouted, standing up in the boat, and holding on to the
line with all his might; but being unable to keep his
footing, he flung himself prone across the row-bench and
would inevitably have been pulled overboard if Harry
and Olaf had not caught hold of him by the legs and
told him to let the line go.</p>

<p>“You remind me of the Englishman at the siege of
Quebec who had caught three Frenchmen,” said Harry.
“I should say it was the whale who had caught you, in
the present case, if a whale it is. Now <em>I</em> am going to try
my luck,” he added, seizing the wooden frame to which
the line was attached just as it was about to fly overboard.
He braced himself against the mast and flung
his body backward, but the line cut into his hands so
terribly that he had to cry for help. Then Olaf was
promptly at his side, and by their united efforts they
succeeded in hauling in a couple of fathoms; but it was
not until one of the boatmen added his strength to theirs
that they made any sensible headway. Great was their
delight when, at the end of five minutes, they caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
sight of an enormous halibut, weighing some forty or
fifty pounds, but, as well might be imagined, it was no
easy job to get such a monster into the boat without upsetting
it. The only way was evidently to tire him out
until he lost all power of resistance, and as he had swallowed
the metal bait with tremendous vim there was no
danger of his escaping.</p>

<p>It was well on toward evening when they put into
harbor on the northern coast of Lofoten, where they
were to remain while the fisheries lasted. An endless
double row of boats stretched along the shore, and behind
these the so-called “Hjælder,” or drying-houses,
rose in gaunt perspective against the dark sky. Thousands
of boats were drawn up along the whole beach,
and the smell of fish pervaded the air and seemed even
to be borne in on the ocean breeze. Grim, followed by
all the men from the three boats, marched up to the
Hasselrud booth, which he unlocked, and ordered the
temporary cook to make a fire on the hearth and to
prepare supper. It was a large empty room, one wall of
which was occupied by the hearth and two by rows of
bunks, one above the other, resembling the berths in
the steerage of an immigrant steamer. It looked cheerless,
and the boys, whose expectations had pictured to
them something quite different, shivered at the sight of
the bare and sooty walls. Nevertheless when the fire
had been lighted, and a couple of burning pine knots
stuck into the wall, they took heart again and determined
to make the best of the situation.</p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak they jumped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
their clothes, pulling complete oil-cloth suits on the outside
of their ordinary garments. Then fastening their
yellow sou’westers under their chins, they surveyed each
other with undisguised looks of admiration and began to
feel like real fishermen. The breakfast was swallowed in
haste, and they scarcely noticed how the hot coffee
scalded their mouths, so eager were they to be off.
Nevertheless, as they had no nets to draw as yet, they
delayed their departure for several hours. It was a raw,
cold morning, but the signals at the government station
indicated fair but blustery weather. The whole fleet had
already started, and the Hasselrud boats were among the
last to set sail for the fishing-banks. It was glorious to
see the wide ocean studded, as far as the eye could reach,
with swelling sails, and the air filled for miles with a
screaming host of great, white-winged sea-birds. Round
about the whales were spouting, shooting columns of
water into the gray light of the morning: and the auks
were rocking upon the waves, and vanishing, quick as a
flash, as soon as a boat approached them. The fresh sea-breeze
blew into the faces of the three boys, and they
felt like Norse Vikings of the olden time starting out in
search of fame and adventures. It was about twelve
o’clock when they arrived at the fishing-banks; the sails
were lowered and the nets sunk by means of lead sinkers
and stones attached to their lower edge. Wooden floats,
similarly attached to their upper edge, held them in position
in the water. Grim sat, grave and imperturbable, in
the stern, issuing his commands in a voice which rose
high above the rushing of the water and the whizzing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
the wind, and every man obeyed with a promptness as if
his life depended upon it. The sea was so packed with
cod that the nets often stopped, gliding slowly over the
backs of the fishes, and being again arrested by the
myriads of finny creatures below. Often the same net
had to be taken up and disentangled several times before
it made its way to the bottom. The water was thick
with spawn, which clung in long gelatinous ropes to the
blades of the oars, and doubled their weight to the
rowers. The boys, leaning out over the gunwale, could
see the huge male cods winding themselves onward
through the dense throngs of females which stood still
with their noses against the current, moving their fins, and
shedding their spawn. It seemed a positive mercy to haul
up a million or so of them, just to make room for the rest.</p>

<p>“I understand now,” exclaimed Harry, “how the Canadians
managed to cheat us out of so much money&mdash;six
millions, more or less, I think&mdash;because we had encroached
upon their fishing-grounds. I would myself
pay a good round sum for sport like this; and the joke
of it is that you are making money at it and have all the
fun in the bargain.”</p>

<p>“And have ye fisheries in America too, lad?” Grim
asked, with visible interest, as he let the last float slip
from his hand.</p>

<p>“Have we got fisheries in America? Well, I should
say we had, old man,” said Harry, fired with patriotic
ardor. “You just tell me what we haven’t got in America.
If you’ll come over and see I shall be happy to entertain
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ye are safe in invitin’ me, lad,” Grim retorted, biting
a quid from his roll of tobacco. “A purty figger an old
sea-dog like me would make in your ma’s carpeted parlor.”</p>

<p>Harry in his heart admitted the force of this remark,
and he laughed to himself at the thought of Grim’s ungainly
form seated in one of his mother’s spindle-legged
blue satin chairs; but, for all that, he liked Grim too
much to wish to offend him, and therefore stuck bravely
to his invitation, insisting that it was sincerely meant.
As they were amicably squabbling, the sun suddenly
burst forth, and flung its dazzling radiance upon the
ocean. The noise of the sea-birds grew louder, making
the vast vault of the sky alive with countless varieties of
screams. The fishes leaped, the whales spouted lustily,
the stormy petrel danced over the crests of the billows;
thousands of boats lay bobbing up and down on the
waves, while the lines were being baited; a thousand
voices shouted to each other from boat to boat; oars and
rudders rattled, and the wind sang in the mast-tops. It
was a scene which once seen could never be forgotten.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Long before the Hasselrud men had their lines set the
whole fleet had rowed back toward land. But Grim’s
boat-guild, which had just arrived, and had as yet no
nets to draw, lingered for a while eating their dinner,
which they had brought with them in the boats. They
chatted and told stories about Draugen, the sea-bogey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
who rows in a half boat, and whose scream sounds terribly
through the tempest. Any man who sees him
knows that he will never see land again. Draugen is
only out in the worst weather; he has a sou’wester on
his head, his face is white and ghastly as death itself, and
his empty eye-sockets have no eyes in them. The boys
shuddered at the horrible picture which was conjured up
before them, and it was a relief to them when the time
came for pulling up the lines, and the great codfishes
were hauled sprawling into the boat; each one had
plenty to do now in cutting out the hooks and in winding
the lines upon their frames. A smart gale had
sprung up while they were thus engaged, and Grim began
to look wistfully at the lurid sunset.</p>

<p>“The sun draws water,” he said; “that means lively
weather. Hoist the sails, lads, and let us turn our noses
shoreward.”</p>

<p>He had hardly uttered his command when a thick
curtain seemed to be drawn across the face of the sun,
and the sea became black as ink.</p>

<p>“Clew up the sail!” he shouted, in a voice of thunder;
“we are in for it.”</p>

<p>With a roar as of a chorus of cataracts the storm advanced,
lashing the water into smoke which whirled
heavenward, making the sky dense as night. The masts
creaked, the boats tore away with a frantic speed, and
the waves rose mountain-high, with steep, black gulfs between
them.</p>

<p>“Cap’n,” one of the men ventured to remonstrate,
“are we not carryin’ too much sail?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Grim deigned him no reply, but, with a sharp turn
of the tiller, ran The Cormorant closer to the wind.
Forward bounded the boat, cleaving the coming wave
with a blow of her bows which made her timbers groan.
The spray was dashed fathoms high, and would have
drenched every man on board if his oil-skins had not
been water-tight. Of the other boats only two were visible,
and it was splendid to see how they rose out of one
sea, until half the length of their keels were visible, then
buried their noses in the next, while great sheets of foam
splashed on either side, and were torn into shreds by the
gale.</p>

<p>“This is rather lively work, I should say,” remarked
the midshipman. “I think I should prefer a man-of-war
to The Cormorant in this sort of weather.”</p>

<p>“I confess to a weakness for Cunarders,” said Harry;
“yet I dare say I shall enjoy this affair well enough when
we get safely ashore.”</p>

<p>“You mean <em>if</em> we get safely ashore,” said Magnus,
quietly. “This has rather an ugly look to me. Though
I dare say Grim knows what he is about.”</p>

<p>He had scarcely spoken when a harsh voice bellowed,
“Lay hold of the mast, lads!” and in the same moment
they seemed to be flung to a dizzying height; a huge
wave towered in front, showing a white whirling top
which seemed on the point of breaking right over them.
They had just time to clasp the mast when the boat,
lying flat on her side, pressed down by her weight of canvas,
plunged her nose into this mountain of water, but
by some astonishing manœuvre righted herself, slid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
within another black hollow, and again rose high on the
crest of another wave.</p>

<p>“All hands bail!” roared the captain.</p>

<p>The command came not a moment too soon; the
water was rushing in from the leeward, and the flying
wreaths of foam struck the boy’s faces with a terrible
force and made them smart furiously.</p>

<p>“Grim! Grim!” shouted Olaf, making himself heard
with a difficulty above the storm, “you are carrying too
much sail.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, gosling,” Grim thundered back;
“we have got nothin’ but the sail fer to save us.”</p>

<p>“What point are you making for?”</p>

<p>“The Bird Islands.”</p>

<p>“I thought there was no harbor there.”</p>

<p>“Reckon ye be right.”</p>

<p>“Gracious heavens!” cried Olaf, turning a terrified
countenance toward his comrades; “he means to wreck
the boat; but he knows what he is about. There is no
other chance.”</p>

<p>He sat for a moment silent, gazing up into the cloud
rack which scudded along at a furious rate before the
wind. Strips of storm-riven sky, with momentary vistas
of blue, were now and then visible, but vanished again,
making the dusk more dismal by their memory.</p>

<p>“Breakers ahead!” shouted Olaf, “look out!”</p>

<p>“I see a black ridge against the sky,” cried Harry;
“now it is gone again!”</p>

<p>He was going to say more, but the wind came with a
howling screech and forced his breath down his throat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
He gasped, and as the boat gave a tremendous lurch,
diving down into a black hollow, he could only cling to
the base of the mast, lest the next tumble might toss him
overboard. The sound of a steady rhythmic roar rose
and fell upon the air, and made them strain their eyes in
the direction from which it was coming.</p>

<p>“Why, Grim, you are steering away from the island,”
Magnus screamed, pointing to the black ridge which was,
once more, for a moment revealed.</p>

<p>“He means to land us on the leeward side,” Olaf
bawled in his brother’s ear; “the chances are that the
water is there a bit smoother.”</p>

<p>To reach the leeward side was, however, a task which
required no mean order of seamanship. The distance
was too short for tacking, and moreover the water was
filled with blind rocks and skerries which made the approach
tenfold dangerous. It seemed to the unskilled
eyes of the boys that for nearly half an hour The Cormorant
was tumbling aimlessly upon the waves, shipping
seas which it was a wonder did not swamp her, and
righting herself, as by a miracle, when again and again
she seemed on the point of capsizing. And yet all these
wonderful feats were only the result of the coolest calculation
and the most consummate skill.</p>

<p>Just as they were clearing the hidden skerries at the
western point of the island the wind veered a point to
the north, but did not fall off perceptibly. The spray
rose from the shore like a dense and blinding smoke, and
in the depths of every black abyss which opened before
them death’s jaws seemed to be yawning. Harry closed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
his eyes; and though he was no coward, his heart failed
him.</p>

<p>“What is the use of fighting any longer?” he said to
Magnus, who was lying at his side, clinging like him to
the mast; “we are going to the bottom, any way. The
archangel Gabriel himself couldn’t land us on this shore,
with all the heavenly hosts to assist him.”</p>

<p>“But Grim is a better sailor than Gabriel,” Magnus
replied, quite unconscious of his joke. “He knows
every inch of the bottom here from the time he was a
boy and used to row out here and gather eider-down.
He has told me about it often. If I were you I wouldn’t
give up yet.”</p>

<p>“All right, old fellow,” Harry answered, taking heart
once more. “I am ready for anything. But I am an
unlucky chap&mdash;a sort of a Jonah, who has a talent for
getting into scrapes. I shouldn’t wonder if, in case you
threw me overboard, the storm would fall off and you
might sail home in comfortable fashion.”</p>

<p>“We mean to go overboard, all of us, in a few minutes,”
Magnus retorted, hugging Harry tightly with his
left arm, which he had freed for that purpose. “Now I
am going to propose something to you. Let us tie ourselves
together with a rope so that each may help the
other; and we may either live or perish together.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you would be the loser by that arrangement,”
his friend exclaimed. “You are a good deal
stronger than I am, and you will need every bit of your
strength if you are to plow your way through those awful
breakers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>Magnus, instead of answering, slipped the end of a
rope about Harry’s waist and secured it tightly; the
other end he tied about his own waist, although he came
near losing his balance, and going headlong over the gunwale.
The Cormorant had now slipped around to the
leeward side of the island, where, under the shelter of the
steep rock, the water was a trifle less tumultuous. And
yet a gigantic surf was running and the undertow on the
steeply sloping bottom seemed strong enough to take an
elephant off his feet. The wind yelled and screeched from
the top of the towering rock, and rushed down in thundering
eddies on the leeward side. If it had not been for a
momentary clearing of the sky, which showed the position
of the breakers and the outline of the shore, it would
have been madness to risk landing; and even as it was,
the chance of being dashed to pieces against the rocks
seemed altogether to preponderate. But Grim apparently
took a different view of the situation; as long as
the sail was whole and the boat true to her rudder he saw
no cause for despair.</p>

<p>“Now, lads,” he roared, hoarsely, “steady on yer shanks.
No chicken-hearted chap among ye! Uncoil the rope!
Thar’s a bit of sandy beach thar&mdash;sixty or a hundred feet
wide. If we be in luck we’ll be thar in a minute.”</p>

<p>The ridge of the island was now half visible against
the dark horizon, but the beach below was wrapped in a
dense smoke, through which came glimpses of the black
jagged rock.</p>

<p>“Almighty Lord! thar’s a skerry ahead,” screamed one
of the boatmen, as the retreating surf broke with a wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
uproar over the hidden rock and rose like a mighty water-spout
against the sky. There was a moment of breathless
suspense. Each man seemed to hear the beating of
the other’s heart. As the boat was flung upward again
on the next wave, the wind gave a frantic shriek; the
mast bent forward under the terrible strain. The incoming
surf buried the skerry under a mountain of towering
water, and high upon its crest The Cormorant rode
triumphant, only to be hurled from its crest, fairly shooting
through the air, upon the beach.</p>

<p>“Jump overboard!” bellowed Grim, and seizing
Magnus in his arms he leaped from the stern just as
the boat struck the sand and broke into fragments.
Every man followed his example; but the undertow
swept them off their feet. Still Grim stood like a rock,
holding with his gigantic strength the rope to the other
end of which Harry was attached. Once he tottered,
and if he had had sand under his feet he would have
been dragged down by his double burden. But by a
lucky chance he had planted his heels upon a bowlder
which rose slightly out of the surf. When the wildest
force of the wave had been exhausted he sprang up on
the beach, depositing Magnus and the half-unconscious
Harry beyond the reach of the waves. Back he rushed
again to his former station, just as one of the boatmen,
who had momentarily regained his footing, was scrambling
up toward him.</p>

<p>“I am tied to the rope,” shouted the man; “someone
is tugging at it.”</p>

<p>“Hand it to me,” commanded Grim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>The man struggled to his feet and planted himself
resolutely at his captain’s side. All this was the work
of a moment. With the next incoming wave, which was
happily much smaller than the preceding one, four men
were flung up on the sand; but they seemed half dead,
and made no effort to save themselves. Grim, who
thought he saw a glimmer of brass buttons in the water,
dashed forward and seized Olaf by the collar, just as he
would have been sucked back by the undertow. He
bore him up on the shore, while the boatman came dragging
two of his unconscious comrades out of the roaring
surf. One was still missing; but as the next wave that
broke in tumult at their feet showed no trace of him, they
knew that he was beyond the reach of human help.</p>

<p>The work of resuscitating the men was a long and
tedious one; but Grim and Magnus both worked with
their hearts in their throats, yet with a resolution which
scorned fatigue. Harry revived the moment they had
poured a glass of brandy down his throat, and he soon
recovered his spirits and volunteered his help. But the
midshipman was both badly battered and had swallowed
a quantity of water; and it was only after long and persistent
efforts on Grim’s part that his breath came back
to him. Their next thought was of fire; for the wind
was raw and chill, and the last glimmer of daylight was
vanishing. The problem, however, was a serious one,
for there was not a tree growing on the island, except
perhaps a few stunted juniper shrubs up in the crevices
of the rocks. And to get at these in the dark was no
easy undertaking. Nor was their situation in other re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>spects
an enviable one. Above them loomed the black
cliff, and the surf was thundering at their feet. And
there they were sitting, huddled together in a heap to
keep each other warm, and yet shivering in their wet
clothes, and thinking with horror of the long hours of
the night which must pass before they could be rescued.</p>

<p>“Lads,” cried Magnus, suddenly extricating himself
from Harry and Olaf’s embrace, “I am the only one of
you who is not wet to the skin, and I am going to explore
this island and see if we can’t scare up some fuel.
To sit here hugging each other in the dark is a dismal
sort of business, and I am not so affectionately disposed
as the rest of you.”</p>

<p>“A mighty peart chap ye be, lad,” Grim said, raising
his tall figure out of the group; “but ye had better let
me crawl ahead, and ye keep astern o’ me. I know summat
o’ the island and ye don’t know nothin’.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep abreast of you, Grim,” Magnus replied,
“but your stern would obscure my view; so take your
bearings and let’s be off.”</p>

<p>“Ye be a mighty lively customer,” Grim grumbled,
admiringly, giving the boy a caressing pat in the dark.</p>

<p>They had scarcely crawled fifty yards up the beach
when their fumbling hands touched something cold and
clammy, which felt like the nose of some aquatic animal.
There came immediately a little chorus of whining barks,
which was followed by a great flapping, as if something
broad and wet struck against the stones.</p>

<p>“Thunder and lightning, Grim,” cried Magnus, “what
sort of beasts are these?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>“A herd of seals,” answered Grim, quietly; “it was
funny I didn’t think o’ them. Here we have got our
fuel.”</p>

<p>In the same moment a cold nose was stuck right into
Magnus’ face and he tumbled backward, scarcely knowing
how to return the unexpected caress.</p>

<p>“Draw yer knives, lads,” shouted Grim to the men,
“a herd of seals is a comin’ right upon ye.”</p>

<p>The seals were now in full flight, rolling, tumbling, and
pushing themselves on over the smooth sand. They instinctively
knew, even in the dark, the way to the water,
and they thus came plump down upon the shipwrecked
men, who had arisen in response to Grim’s call and were
ready to give them a warm reception. In the storm and
the fright of the sudden attack the keen scent of the animals
scarcely served them at all. They rushed right
down upon their enemies, and within a few minutes fully
a dozen of them lay gasping and bleeding upon the
beach. The rest plunged into the surf, where their
plaintive bark was heard as they battled with the raging
sea.</p>

<p>Grim and Magnus in the meanwhile pushed on, groping
their way over the slippery bowlders, and keeping
close together so as to help each other in case of accident.
But the farther they climbed the steeper grew
the rock, and as far as they could ascertain by their sense
of touch there was no sign of vegetation.</p>

<p>“Now look sharp, lad,” cried Grim, warningly.</p>

<p>“Look sharp!” repeated Magnus, “how am I to look
sharp when it is as dark as pitch about me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“Right ye be, lad, right ye be,” the other retorted;
“ye be a smart chap and a peart one. But don’t ye lay
hold o’ nothin’ here before ye know it is rock. Thar be
thousands o’ birds here on the lee’ard side when thar be
a storm from the north; and ef ye mistook a gull or a
cormorant fer somethin’ solid ye might tumble down and
break yer precious neck. Mark ye my word, chap, thar
will be a mighty lively hubbub here in a couple o’ minutes.”</p>

<p>Grim had hardly uttered this prophecy when Magnus
felt something feathery under his touch, and in the same
instant there came a piercing scream and a powerful wing
dealt him a blow across the bridge of his nose. Immediately
there commenced a wild chorus of screams and
chattering protest, as if the more sober-minded birds
were deprecating this senseless uproar. Magnus thought,
too, that he heard his name called from below, but the
deafening thunder of the surf and the noise of the birds
drowned all other sounds, and he concluded that he had
been deceived. It was a terrible sensation, all these invisible
wings flapping about him in the dark; unseen
bodies precipitated against him and tumbling blindly
about him with a murderous tumult from a thousand
discordant voices. He raised his elbows above his head
to protect himself from the blind assaults and the perpetual
beating of wings. It hardly occurred to him to
assume the offensive until he heard Grim’s voice shouting
to him:</p>

<p>“Draw yer knife, lad, and make it lively fer them
screamin’ rascals. Their down is worth money and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
they’ve got blubber as thick as a seal’s. Give ’em no
odds, I tell ye, my laddie.”</p>

<p>Magnus followed this advice promptly. He drew his
knife, and fought with a will, thrusting and striking right
and left, and hearing the great birds tumbling about him
down the steep sides of the rock. He had been thus
occupied for a few minutes when suddenly, to his unutterable
amazement, a great blaze rose from the strand below,
lighting up the barren wall of the cliff, and showing
him how narrow the ledge was upon which he was sitting.
It was a superb spectacle, too, to see the whirling host
of gulls, auks, and cormorants eddying wildly about his
head, the great black cliff looming up above him, and the
spray of the surf spouting, with angry brawl, high up
into the nocturnal air.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! lad,” yelled Grim, through the ear-splitting
noise and confusion, “I war a blasted fool not to think
on it. They be a-burnin’ the wreck.”</p>

<p>The descent was a much easier affair than the ascent;
for the light of the fire below blazed up every now and
then and enabled them to see where they were treading.
They picked up between them several dozen birds, of
nearly half as many varieties, and flung them down before
the fire, where the company were now seated in
comparative comfort, warming their stiffened limbs.
Two of the boatmen were engaged in skinning the seals
and cutting off the blubber, which, after squeezing out
the blood, they flung into the fire. Soon the oil began
to ooze out, and, flowing over the wood, burned with a
clear and strong flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am going to make myself comfortable, fellows,”
said Harry, who was looking very pale and chilly after
his involuntary bath; “and if you don’t mind it, I’ll
make a scarf of this big duck. She fits very nicely about
my throat, though she won’t accommodate herself to the
bow-knot. This little one I am going to stuff down my
bosom. She feels so deliciously warm and downy! I
tell you,” he went on, with emphasis, suiting his actions
to his words, “I mean to patent this invention, when I
get back home, as an infallible cure for rheumatism,
toothache, consumption, chillblains, corns, and kidney
disease. I am going to call it Winchester’s In-<em>w</em>incible
<em>W</em>ivifier. That will sound well and catch the public
eye. I was about ready to give up the ghost awhile ago,
and now I feel quite jolly.”</p>

<p>He stretched himself luxuriously on the windward side
of the fire, arranged half a dozen ducks and auks under
his head as a pillow, and closed his eyes. Magnus and
Olaf soon followed his example, each tying a big gull
about his throat, and feeling a grateful warmth creeping
through their half-frozen bodies. The men had the good
luck to find a bunch of drift-wood large enough to keep
the fire going until morning, and to satisfy their hunger
they roasted a piece of seal-flesh, which, in spite of its
oily flavor, tasted better than they had expected. When
Grim saw that the boys were asleep he covered them
carefully with his own oil-skin clothes, while he himself
kept marching up and down on the beach to keep his
blood in motion. After midnight the wind shifted suddenly
to the west and fell off gradually, the clouds were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
scattered, and the moon sailed calmly through the dark-blue
sky.</p>

<p>The three boys slept soundly after their terrible hardships,
and the eastern sky was already bright with the
dawn when they opened their eyes. The whole screaming
colony of birds were again on the wing, and whirled
about the projecting crags of the cliff with wild clamor.
Several sails were already visible on the horizon and, as
soon as signals of distress were hoisted, steered toward
the island. Harry, who was ravenously hungry, made a
courageous assault upon the roasted seal-flesh, but after
two futile attempts declared that he was not sufficiently
acclimated to relish such diet. If necessity compelled
him, he preferred to roast his boots, and to use the seal-oil
as gravy.</p>

<p>“What do you say you call this island?” he asked
Grim, who was trotting at his side up and down on the
sand.</p>

<p>“The Bird Island,” answered Grim.</p>

<p>“I should rather call it the ‘Skerry of Shrieks,’” said
Harry; “for in all my living days I have never heard a
finer assortment of varied yells than I heard here last
night. It must be a jolly place in summer, when the
nights are light and the weather comfortable.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t bad fer such as like it,” was Grim’s non-committal
reply.</p>

<p>“And do you know,” Magnus put in eagerly, “during
the early fall the island is quite covered with eider-ducks’
nests, so that you can hardly move your feet without
stepping into them. All those little round depressions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
up on the slope there are such nests; and thousands
of dollars have been made here in times past by gathering
the down with which the eider-duck lines her nest;
and it is even possible during the brooding season to
catch the bird alive and pull the down from her breast;
though I think that would be cruel, as she probably
needs all she has left after having picked herself for the
benefit of her young.”</p>

<p>“The eider-duck must be very tame,” Harry observed.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is very tame, indeed, because people rarely
molest it,” said Magnus; “the peasants have a kind of
superstitious respect for it, and they won’t allow anyone
to kill it. It is very much the same kind of feeling
as they have for the swallow. They think a misfortune
will befall him who robs or pulls down a swallow’s
nest.”</p>

<p>Several boats were by this time within hailing distance,
and they were easily persuaded to run up and take the
shipwrecked company on board. They insisted, however,
upon drawing their nets before returning, and thus
it happened that it was nearly noon before the party set
foot on shore. They now learned that a great many
boats besides their own had been wrecked during yesterday’s
storm, and that some fifty or sixty men had been
drowned. Many dead bodies were washed ashore during
the day, and some were even drawn up in the nets and
sent home to their sorrowing widows. Sad, indeed, was
the sight of the little fleet of boats which sailed southward
that afternoon, each with a tarred pine box show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>ing
above its gunwales. The three boys, although they
would scarcely have admitted that the disaster had discouraged
them, concluded, after a short consultation, that
the experience they had already had of the fisheries was
an instructive one and would probably last them for the
remainder of their lives. They therefore, without much
regret, induced Grim to hoist the sails and pilot them
safely home.</p>

<h2><a name="FIDDLE-JOHNS_FAMILY" id="FIDDLE-JOHNS_FAMILY"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">FIDDLE-JOHN’S FAMILY.</a></h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>“Queer sort of chap that Fiddle-John is,” said the
men, when Fiddle-John went by.</p>

<p>“Quaint sort o’ cr’atur’ is Fiddle-John,” echoed the
women; “not much in the providin’ line.”</p>

<p>“A singular individual is that Violin-John,” said the
parson; “I can never make up my mind whether he is a
worthless scamp or a man of genius.” “Possibly both,”
suggested the parson’s wife. “Apartments to let,” remarked
the daughter, tapping her forehead significantly.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! There is Fiddle-John,” cried the children,
flocking delightedly about him, clinging to his arms, his
legs, and his coat-tails. “Sing us a song, Fiddle-John!
Tell us a story!”</p>

<p>Then Fiddle-John would seat himself on a stone at
the road-side, while the children nestled about him;
and he would tell them stories about knights and ladies,
and ogres, and princesses, and all sorts of marvellous
things.</p>

<p>“Worthless fellow, that Fiddle-John,” said the passers-by;
“there he sits in the middle of the day talking non<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>sense
to the children, when he ought to be working for
the support of his family.”</p>

<p>It was perfectly true; Fiddle-John ought to have been
working. He would readily have admitted that himself.
He was well aware that his wife, Ingeborg, was at home,
working like a trooper to keep the family from starving.
But then, somehow, Fiddle-John had no taste for work,
while Ingeborg had. He much preferred singing songs
and telling stories. And a very pretty picture he made,
as he sat there at the roadside, with his handsome, gentle
face, his large blue eyes, and his wavy blond hair,
and the children nestling about him, listening in wide-eyed
wonder. There was something very attractive
about his face, with its mild, melancholy smile, and a
sort of diffident, questioning look in the eyes. He had
an odd habit of opening his mouth several times before
he spoke, and then, possibly, if his questioner’s face did
not please him, he would go away, having said nothing.
And, after all, it was diffidence and not insolence which
prompted this action. It would never have occurred to
Fiddle-John to take a critical view of anybody; he approved
of all humanity in general, only he had an intuitive
suspicion when anyone was making fun of him, and
in such cases he found safety only in flight and silence.</p>

<p>By profession Fiddle-John was a ballad-singer; a
queer profession, you will say, but nevertheless one
which in Norway enjoys a certain recognition. He had
a voice which the angels might have envied him&mdash;a clear
and sweet tenor which rang through the depths of the
listener’s soul. Hearing that voice, it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
not to stay and listen. The deputy sheriff, who once
came to arrest Fiddle-John for vagrancy, when Fiddle-John
began to sing, sat and cried. It came over him so
“sorter queer,” he said. The parson, who had made up
his mind to give Fiddle-John a thundering reproof for
neglect of his family, the first time he should catch him,
quite forgot his sinister purpose when, one day, he saw
the ballad-singer seated under a large tree, with a dozen
children climbing over him, and, with rollicking laughter,
tumbling and rolling about him. And when Fiddle-John,
having quieted his audience, took two little girls
on his lap, while the boys scrambled and fought for the
places nearest to him, the parson could not for the life
of him recall the harsh things he had meant to say to
Fiddle-John. The fact was&mdash;though, of course, it is
scarcely fair to tell&mdash;the ballad which Fiddle-John sang
to the children reminded the parson of the time (now
long ago) when he was paying court to Mrs. Parson, and
sometimes, on slight provocation, dropped into poetry.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">“Thy cheeks are like the red, red rose,</p>
<p class="verse">Thy hands are like the lily.”</p>
</div></div>

<p>These were the very extraordinary sentiments which
the parson had, at that remote period, professed toward
Mrs. Parson, and these were the very words which
Fiddle-John was now singing. No wonder the parson
forgot that he had come to scold Fiddle-John. “I
suppose that such good-for-nothings may be good for
something, after all,” he said to his wife as he related the
incident at the dinner-table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Fiddle-John and his family lived in a little cottage
close up under the mountain-side, where the sun did not
reach until late in the afternoon. In the winter they
were sometimes snowed down so completely that they
had to work until noon before they could get a glimpse
of the sky. The two boys, Alf and Truls, would go early
in the morning with their snow-shovels and dig a tunnel
to the cow-stable, where a lonely cow, a pig, and three
sheep were penned up. Their father would then sit at
the window, holding a lantern, the light of which vaguely
penetrated the darkness and showed them in what direction
they were digging; but, after awhile, this monotonous
occupation wearied him, and he would take his
fiddle and play the most mournful tunes he could think
of. It never occurred to him to lend a helping hand;
and it never occurred to the boys to ask him.</p>

<p>They accepted their fate without much reasoning; it
seemed part of the right order of things that they and
their mother should work, while their father played and
sang. Ingeborg, their mother, had nursed a kind of tender
reverence for him in their hearts, since they were
babes. He seemed scarcely part of the coarse and common
work-a-day world to which they belonged; with his
gentle, handsome face, and his clear blue eyes, he seemed
like some superior being who conferred a favor upon
them by merely consenting to grant them his company.
His songs travelled from one end of the valley to the
other, and everybody learned them by heart and sang
them at weddings, dances, and funerals. Even though
the parishioners might themselves find fault with Fiddle-John,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
and call him quaint and queer, they stood up for
him bravely if a stranger ventured to attack him.</p>

<p>They knew there was not another such singer in the
whole land, and it was even said that people had come
from foreign lands and had made him enormous offers if
he would go with them and sing at concerts in the great
foreign cities. Thousands of dollars he might have
earned if he had gone, but Fiddle-John knew better than
to abandon the valley of his birth, where he had been
known since his babyhood, and trust himself to the faithless
foreign world. Thousands of dollars! Only think
of it! The very thought made Fiddle-John dizzy; ten
or twenty dollars would have presented something definite
to his imagination, which he would have comprehended,
but thousands of dollars was a blank enormity
which diffused itself like mist through his dazed brain.
And yet Fiddle-John could never stop thinking of the
thousands of dollars which he might have earned, if he
had gone with the foreigner. If the truth must be told, he
himself would have liked well enough to go; and it was
only the persuasions of Ingeborg, his wife, which had restrained
him. “What could you do in the great foreign
world, John,” she had said to him; “you, with your want
of book-learning and your simple peasant ways? They
would laugh at you, John, dear, and that would make me
cry, and we should both be miserable. And all the little
children here in the valley, what would they do without
you, and who would sing to them and tell them stories
when you were gone?”</p>

<p>The last argument was what decided Fiddle-John,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
He did not believe that people would laugh at him in
the great foreign world, but he did believe that the children
would miss him when he was gone, and he could
not bear to think of someone else sitting under the
great maple-tree at the roadside and telling them stories.
For all that, he regretted many a time that he had been
soft-hearted, and had allowed the gate of glory to be
slammed in his face, as he expressed it. He had never
suspected it before; but now the thought began to grow
upon him, that he was a great man, who might have
gained honor and renown if his wife had not deprived
him of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Every day the valley seemed to be growing darker
and narrower; the sight of the mountains became oppressive;
it was as if they weighed upon Fiddle-John’s
breast and impeded his breath. With feverish restlessness
he roamed about from farm to farm and played,
until every string on his fiddle seemed on the point of
snapping.</p>

<p>“I am a great man,” he reflected indignantly, “and
might have earned thousands of dollars. And yet here
I go and fiddle for half-drunken boors at twenty-five
cents a night.”</p>

<p>And to drown the voices that rose clamorously out of
the depths of his soul, he strummed the strings wildly;
and the peasants whirled madly around him, shouted,
and kicked the rafters in the ceiling. The gentleness
and the mild radiance which had made the children love
him passed out of his countenance; his eyes grew restless,
his motions aimless and unsteady. Sometimes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
flung back his head defiantly and mumbled threats between
his teeth; at other times he shuffled along dejectedly,
or lay under a tree, dreaming of the great world
which had forever been closed to him.</p>

<p>“If I had only dared!” he whispered to himself;
“oh, if I had only dared!”</p>

<p>At that moment someone stepped up to him and
shook him by the shoulder. “Hallo, old chap,” said
the man, “you are just the fellow I want! You are the
party they call Fiddle-John?”</p>

<p>There was something brisk and aggressive about the
stranger which almost frightened Fiddle-John. It was
easy to see that he came from afar; for he had smartly-cut
city-clothes, a tall shiny hat, and a huge watch-chain
from which half a dozen seals and trinkets depended.
Fiddle-John had never seen anything so magnificent; he
was completely dazzled. He sat half-raised upon his
elbow and stared at the stranger in mute wonder.
“Well, Fiddle-John,” the latter went on glibly; “you
don’t seem very cordial to an old friend. Or perhaps
you don’t know me. Reckon I’ve changed some since
you used to tell me stories about the Ashiepattle and
the ogre who stowed his heart away for safe keeping
inside of a duck in a goose-pond, some thousands of
miles off. I have often thought of that story since.
Fact is, that is just the kind of arrangement I am after.
I’ve too much heart, Fiddle-John, too much heart. My
heart is always getting me into trouble, and if I could
make an arrangement to leave it behind here in Norway,
while I myself return to America, I should like it first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
rate. You don’t happen to know of any party who
would be willing to keep it for me during my absence,
hey, Fiddle-John?”</p>

<p>The man here laughed uproariously and slapped Fiddle-John
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“You are the same rum old customer you used to be,
Fiddle-John,” he said in a tone of cordial good-fellowship;
“but you don’t seem as talkative as you used to
be&mdash;don’t even tell me you are glad to see me. Now,
that’s what I call hard, Fiddle-John. Don’t even know
the name of your little friend James Forrest&mdash;or&mdash;beg
your pardon&mdash;Jens Skoug, I mean to say, who used to
climb on your back and listened in rapture to your wonderful
voice and your marvellous fairy tales.”</p>

<p>A gleam of intelligence flitted across Fiddle-John’s
features, as he heard the name Jens Skoug, and he arose
with bashful hesitancy and extended his hand to the
talkative stranger. He remembered well that Jens’
family had emigrated, some ten years ago, to the United
States, and he remembered also vividly the uncouth little
creature in skin-patched trousers and ragged jacket
who had embarked, at that time, in the great steamer
that came to take the emigrants off to Bergen. And now
this little creature was a tall, dazzling man with a silk
hat and showy jewellery, and an address which a prince
might have envied. Thus reasoned Fiddle-John in his
simplicity. Such a marvellous transformation he had
never in all his life witnessed. The name James Forrest
which Jens had dropped by a deliberate accident also
impressed him strangely. It seemed to add greatly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Jens’ magnificence. A man who could afford to have
such a foreign-sounding name must indeed be a person
of enterprise and prominence. It surrounded Jens with
a delightful foreign flavor which captivated his friend
even more than his brilliant talk. “Jens,” he said, making
an effort to conquer his diffidence, “you have grown
to be a great man, indeed. How could you expect me
to recognize you?”</p>

<p>“A great man!” exclaimed Jens, expanding agreeably
under his friend’s sincere flattery; “no, Fiddle-John, I
am not a great man&mdash;that is, not yet, Fiddle-John.
But I mean to become a great man before I die. In
America, where I live, every man can become great if he
only chooses to. But I thought, being young yet, that I
could afford to spend a couple of months in opening to
my countrymen the same road to fortune which is open
to myself, before I settled down to tackle life in earnest.
Fact is, Fiddle-John, as I said before, I have too much
heart. My conscience would leave me no peace, whenever
I thought of my poor countrymen who were toiling
here at home for twenty-five or forty cents a day, and
scarcely could keep body and soul together, while I could
earn five and ten dollars a day as readily as I could blow
my nose. I positively cried, Fiddle-John, cried like a girl,
when I thought of you and your small chaps and of all
the other poor fellows here in the valley who had such a
hard time of it, tearing off their caps and bowing and
scraping before the parson and the judge and all the big
guns, while in America we step up to the President himself,
wring his hand and say, ‘How are you, old chap?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
I’ll drop in and take pot-luck with you to-morrow, if you
don’t happen to have company.’ And he, likely as not,
will say to me, ‘Right welcome shall you be, Jim; bring
a couple of good fellows along with you. We don’t
stand on ceremony around the White House. Perhaps
I may be able to hunt up a consulship or a foreign mission
for you, if you should happen to be out of office and
pressed for cash.’ Now, that’s what I call good manners,
Fiddle-John, and the chances are ten to one that,
if you call upon him with a note from me, he may set
you up in a right fat office, where you may cock your
head at parsons and judges and feel yourself as big as
the very biggest.”</p>

<p>Fiddle-John listened with eager ears and open mouth
to this alluring narrative. It did not occur to him to
question the truth of what Jens said, for did not his appearance
and his independent and dazzling demeanor
plainly show that he was a great and prosperous man?
And, moreover, how could he have undergone such a
startling transformation in a few years, if it had not been
true, as he said, that the President of the United States
or some other mighty personage took an interest in him.
Fiddle-John had often heard it said that in America all
things were possible; and he had himself read letters
from persons who here at home had been poor tenants or
even day laborers, and who over there had become colonels,
and merchants, and legislators. Therefore, he was
not in the least surprised at the good luck which had
overtaken his former friend. He was only surprised that
the thought of going to America had never occurred to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
before, and he made up his mind on the spot to sell his
cow, his pig, and his three sheep, and take the first ship
for New York. He could scarcely stop to bid Jens Skoug
good-by, so eager was he to rush home and communicate
his resolution to his wife and children. He foresaw that
he would meet with opposition from Ingeborg; but he
steeled his heart against all her entreaties and vowed to
himself that this time he would have his own way.
Was it not enough that she had once nearly ruined his
life? Should he permit her again to snatch the chance
of greatness away from him?</p>

<p>He was flushed and breathless when he reached his
little cottage up under the mountain-wall. It had never
looked so mean and miserable to him as it did at this
moment. The walls were propped up on the north and
west sides with long beams, and dry, brownish grass
from last year grew in tufts along the roof-tree and
drooped down over the eaves. His two sons, Alf and
Truls, were playing bear with their little sister Karen,
who was seven years old. But they rose hurriedly when
they saw their father, and brushed the sand from the
knees of their trousers. There was something in his
bearing and in the expression of his face which vaguely
alarmed them. He stooped no more in walking, but
strode along proudly with uplifted head.</p>

<p>“Boys,” he cried, joyously, “run in and tell your
mother, to-morrow we are going to America!” Ingeborg,
who was just coming across the yard with a new-born
lamb in her arms, paused in consternation, and gazed
with a frightened expression at her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“What has happened to you, John?” she asked, gently.
“I thought that matter about the foreigner was settled
long ago.”</p>

<p>“I tell you, no!” he shouted, wildly; “it is not settled.
It never will be settled as long as there is breath left in
my body. This time I mean to have my own way.
Jens Skoug has come back from America, and he says
that America is the place for me. I knew it all along,
and whether you will follow me or not, I am going.”</p>

<p>“Follow you, John? Yes, if go you must, then I will
follow you. But to America I will not go willingly, unless
I know what we are to do there, and how we are to
make our living. It is a long, long distance, John, across
the great ocean; they speak a language there which
neither you nor I understand.”</p>

<p>Fiddle-John turned impatiently on his heel, as if to say
that he knew all that twaddle from of old; but Ingeborg,
giving the lamb to Alf, went up to him, laid her hand on
his arm, and said:</p>

<p>“You and I have lived together for so many years,
John, and we love each other too well ever to be happy
away from each other. Don’t let us speak harsh words.
They rankle in the bosom and cause pain, long after they
are spoken. If you must go to America, I will go with
you. But I have a feeling that I shall never get there
alive. I beg of you, don’t decide rashly and don’t believe
all that Jens Skoug tells you. He was not a truthful
child, and I doubt if he has grown up to be a good man.
Let us say no more about it to-night. We will sleep on
it, and see how it will look to us to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Fiddle-John was not a bad fellow; on the contrary, he
was quite soft-hearted and easily moved. This wife of
his had toiled in poverty and ill-health all her life long,
and he had never offered to lift a finger to help her.
Yet she loved him, accepting her lot meekly, and
never uttering a word of reproach against him. He had
never observed before how thin and worn she looked,
how hollow her cheeks were, and how large her eyes.
He felt for the first time in his life a pang of remorse.
He had not been a good husband, he thought; not as
good as he might have been. But then he was a great
man, and great men were never the best of husbands.
And when he reached America, and his greatness became
generally recognized, and fortune began to smile upon
him, then he would shower kindness upon her, and she
would be rewarded a thousand-fold for all she had suffered.
Surely, he would turn over a new leaf&mdash;in America.</p>

<p>Thus Fiddle-John consoled himself, when his conscience
grew uneasy. When only they got to America,
he reasoned, then everything would be right. He would
have started without delay if Ingeborg’s health had not
failed so rapidly that the doctor positively forbade her to
think of travelling. The look of suffering and sweet forbearance
upon her face seemed a perpetual reproach to
Fiddle-John, and he roamed restlessly from one end of
the valley to the other, playing, singing, and telling his
stories, in order to earn money for the voyage, he said
to his sons; but, in reality, to escape from the unspoken
reproach of his wife’s countenance. But the day soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
came when he needed no longer to flee from her presence.
One bright spring day, just as the snow was
melting, and the bare spots on the meadows steamed in
the sun, Ingeborg closed her weary eyes forever; and a
few days later she was laid to rest in the shadow of the
old church down on the headland, where the song-thrush
warbles through the brief Arctic summer night.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>Down in the valley the Easter bells were chiming;
the bell-strokes trembled through the clear, sun-steeped
air. There was commotion in the valley, too, in spite of
the fact that it was Easter Sunday. Out in the middle
of the fiord lay a huge black steamer, which panted and
shrieked, as if it were in distress, and sent volumes of
gray smoke out of its chimneys. Around about little
black fragments of coal-dust were drizzling through the
air and swimming on the water; and the gulls which
kept whirling about the smoke-stacks were quite shocked
when they caught the reflections of themselves in the
tide; with wild screams they plunged into the fiord.
They probably mistook themselves for crows.</p>

<p>The pier, which broke the line of the beach at the
point of the headland, was thronged with men, women,
and children. The men were talking earnestly together;
most of the women were weeping, and the children were
gazing impatiently toward the steamboat and tugging
at their mother’s skirts. Some twenty or thirty boats,
heavily laden with chests and boxes, lay at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the pier; and one after another, as it was filled with
people, put off and was rowed out to the steamer. Only
the old folk remained behind; with heavy hearts and
tottering steps they walked up the sloping beach and
stood at the roadside, straining their eyes to catch a last
glimpse of the son or daughter, whom they were never
to see again. Some flung themselves down in the sand
and sobbed aloud; others stooped over the weeping ones
and tried to console them.</p>

<p>At last there was but one little group left on the pier;
and that was composed of Fiddle-John and his three
children. Jens Skoug, the emigration agent, was standing
in a boat, shouting to them to hurry, and the boys
were scrambling down the slippery stairs leading to the
water, while the father followed more deliberately, carrying
the little girl in his arms.</p>

<p>There was a Babel of voices on board; and poor
Fiddle-John and his sons, who had never heard such
noise in their lives before, stood dazed and bewildered,
and had scarcely presence of mind to get out of the way
of the iron chains and pulleys which were hoisting on
board enormous boxes of merchandise, horses, cattle,
pigs, and a variety of other commodities. It was not
until they found themselves stowed away in a dark corner
of the steerage, upon a couple of shelves, by courtesy
styled berths, which had been assigned to them, that
they were able to realize where they were, and that they
were about to leave the land of their fathers and plunge
blindly into a wild and foreign world which they had
scarcely in fancy explored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>The first day on board passed without any incident.
The next day, they reached Hamburg, and were transferred
to a much larger and more comfortable steamer,
named the Ruckert, and before evening the low land of
North Germany traced itself only as a misty line on the
distant horizon. Night and day followed in their monotony;
Russian Mennonites, Altenburg peasants, and
all sorts of queer and outlandish-looking people passed in
kaleidoscopic review before the eyes of the astonished
Norsemen. It was the third day at sea, I think, when
they had got somewhat accustomed to their novel surroundings,
that a little incident occurred which was
fraught with serious consequences to Fiddle-John’s family.</p>

<p>The gong had just sounded for dinner, and the emigrants
were hurrying down-stairs with tin cups and bowls
in their hands. The children were themselves hungry,
and needed no persuasion to follow the general example.
They unpacked their big tin cups, which looked like
wash-basins, and took their seats at an interminably long
table, while the stewards went around with buckets full
of steaming soup, which they poured into each emigrant’s
basin, as it was extended to them, by means of
great iron dippers. Many of the Russians were either
so hungry or so ill-mannered that they could not wait
until their turn came, but rushed forward, clamoring for
soup in hoarse, guttural tones; and one of the stewards,
after having shouted to them in German to take their
places at the tables, finally, by way of argument, gave
one of them a blow on the head with his iron dipper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
Then there arose a great commotion, and everybody supposed
that the angry Mennonites would have attacked the
offending steward. But instead of that, the crowd scattered
and quietly took their places, as they had been
commanded. They were an odd lot, those Mennonites,
thought the Norse boys, who did not know that their
religion forbade them to fight, and compelled them to
pocket injuries without resentment.</p>

<p>Next to Alf, on the same bench, sat a swarthy boy,
fourteen or fifteen years old, with yellow cheeks and
large black eyes. He had a thin iron chain about his
wrist and seemed every now and then to direct his attention
to something under the table. Alf concluded that,
in all probability, he had his bundle of clothes or his
trunk hidden under his feet. But he was not long permitted
to remain in this error. Just as the steward approached
them and extended the long-handled dipper,
filled with soup, a fierce growl was heard under the bench,
and a half-grown black bear-cub rushed out and made a
plunge for his legs. The frightened steward made a
leap, which had the effect of upsetting the soup-pail over
his assailant’s head.</p>

<p>A wild roar of pain followed, and everybody jumped
on tables and benches to see the sport; while the Savoyard
boy who owned the bear darted forward, his eyes
flashing with anger, and hurled a flood of unintelligible
imprecations at the knight of the soup-pail. There was
a sudden change of tone, as he stooped down over his
scalded and dripping pet, and, showering endearing
names upon it, hugged it to his bosom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The emigrants jeered and shouted, the waiters swore,
and the purser, who had been summoned to restore order,
elbowed his way ruthlessly through the crowd until
he reached the author of the tumult.</p>

<p>“How do you dare, you insolent beggar, to bring a
bear into the steerage?” he cried, seizing the boy by the
collar, and shaking him. “Who permitted you to bring
such a dangerous beast&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>His harangue was here suddenly interrupted by the
bear, which calmly rose on its hind legs and, showing its
teeth in an unpleasant manner, prepared to resent such
disrespectful language. The purser took to his heels,
while the steerage rang with jeers and laughter, and the
Savoyard had all he could do to prevent his friend from
pursuing him. The Norse boys, whose sympathy was
entirely with the bear and his master, quite forgot their
hunger in their excitement over the stirring incident;
and when the Savoyard, feeling that the steerage was
scarcely a safe place for him after what had occurred,
mounted the stairs, dragging his bear after him, they
could not resist the temptation to follow him at a respectful
distance. But when they saw him crouching
down behind the big smokestack and gazing timidly
about him while he wiped the bear’s head and face with
his sleeve, they could not conquer the impulse to make
the acquaintance of so distinguished and interesting a
personage. They accordingly sidled up slowly, holding
their sister between them, and were soon face to face with
the Savoyard.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Truls with a bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>ness
which raised him immensely in his brother’s esteem.</p>

<p>The Savoyard shook his head.</p>

<p>“What do people call you when they speak to you?”
Truls repeated, raising his voice and drawing a step
nearer.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Non capisco.</i> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je ne sais pas</i>,” answered the boy in
Italian and French, giving them the choice of the only
two languages he knew.</p>

<p>“Capisco,” Truls went on confidently in his Norse dialect;
“that is a very funny name. I am afraid you don’t
understand me. It wasn’t the bear’s name I asked for;
it was your own.”</p>

<p>The Savoyard shrugged his shoulders expressively,
then poured out a torrent of speech which bewildered
his Norse friends exceedingly. If the bear had opened
its mouth and addressed them in the ursine language, it
would not have succeeded in being more unintelligible.</p>

<p>“You are a very funny chap,” Truls remarked with a
discouraged air. “Why don’t you talk like a Christian?”</p>

<p>He was determined to make no more advances to so
irrational a creature, and was about to lead the way back
to the dinner-table, when the arrival of the purser and
the third officer of the ship again arrested his attention.
The purser had evidently been hunting for the Savoyard;
for, as he caught sight of him, he made an exclamation
in German and called out to the third officer:</p>

<p>“There is the vagabond! Make him understand,
please, that his bear must be shot and that he must get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
out of the way. He has taken out no ticket for his beast
and we don’t take that kind of freight gratis!”</p>

<p>The third officer, who spoke French fluently, explained
the purport of the purser’s remarks to the Savoyard, but
in a gentle and kindly manner which almost deprived
them of their cruel meaning. The boy, however, made
no motion to stir, but remained calmly sitting, with his
arm thrown over the bear’s neck and one hand playing
with his paws.</p>

<p>The officer, seeing that his words had no effect, repeated
his remark with greater emphasis. A startled
look in the boy’s eyes gave evidence that he was beginning
to comprehend. But yet he remained immovable.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, I tell you!” cried the purser,
drawing a revolver from his hip-pocket and pointing it
at the bear’s head. “I have orders to kill this beast,
and I mean to do it now. Quick, now, I don’t want to
hurt you!”</p>

<p>The boy gazed for a moment with a fascinated stare at
the muzzle of the terrible weapon, then sprang up and
flung himself over the bear, covering it with his own
body. The animal, not understanding what all this ado
was about, took it to mean a romp, and began to lick his
master’s face and to claw him with his limp paws.</p>

<p>“Well, I have given you fair warning!” the purser
went on, excitedly, as he vainly tried to find an exposed
vital spot on the bear at which he could fire. “If you
don’t look out, you will have to take the consequences.”
A large crowd had now gathered about them, and a
loud grumble of displeasure made itself heard round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
about. The purser began to perceive that the sentiment
was against him, and that it would scarcely be safe for
him to execute his threat. Yet he found it inconsistent
with his dignity to retire from the contest, and he was
just pausing to deliberate when, all of a sudden, a small
fist struck his wrist and the pistol flew out of his hand
and dropped over the gunwale into the sea. A loud
cheer broke from the crowd. The purser stood utterly
discomfited, scarcely knowing whether he should be angry
with his small assailant or laugh at him. He would,
perhaps, have done the latter if the cheering of the people
and their hostile attitude toward him had not roused
his temper.</p>

<p>“Bravo, Tom Thumb!” they cried. “At him again!
don’t be afraid of the brute because he has got brass buttons
on his coat.”</p>

<p>“Good for you, Ashiepattle!” the Norwegians
shouted; “go it again! We’ll stand by you!”</p>

<p>It was Truls, Fiddle-John’s son, who had thus suddenly
become the hero of the hour; he had acted in the
hot indignation of the moment and was now abashed and
bewildered at the sensation he was making. He looked
anxiously about for his brother and sister, and as soon as he
caught sight of them, was about to make his escape when
the purser seized him by the collar and bade him remain.</p>

<p>“You are a nice one, to be attacking your betters, who
have never given you any provocation,” he said in German,
which Truls, fortunately, did not understand. “I
am going to take you to the captain, and he will have you
punished for assault.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>He made a motion to drag the struggling boy away,
but the crowd closed about him on all sides, and pressed
in upon him with angry shouts and gestures. The third
officer, who had so far taken no part in the proceedings,
now stepped up to the purser and begged him to release
the boy.</p>

<p>“Of course,” he said, “you are in the right; but if I
were you, I would waive my right this time. It’s hardly
worth while making a row about so small a matter; and
it is always bad policy to go to the captain with squabbles
and grievances, especially when they might so easily
have been avoided. I assure you, you will only injure
yourself by doing it.”</p>

<p>They talked for a minute together, while the ever-increasing
throng surged hither and thither about them.
Whether purposely or not, the irate purser, in the zeal of
his argument, released his hold on Truls’ collar, and the
liberated boy dodged away, as quickly as possible, and
was soon lost in the crowd. The Savoyard and his bear
had long before seized the opportunity to withdraw from
the public gaze.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The life on shipboard did not agree with Fiddle-John.
Like a spoiled child, he was restless and unhappy when
he was unnoticed. All day long he sat on the top of a
coil of rope in the forecastle of the ship and sang. The
forecastle was often deserted, and there were probably
not many among the emigrants who would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
capable of judging whether his voice was in any way extraordinary.
And yet, one there was who found an untold
amount of comfort in listening to that clear, sweet
tenor of Fiddle-John’s, and that one was the Savoyard
boy. It had been his constant effort, since his encounter
with the purser, to make himself as inconspicuous as
possible, and it would have gratified him much if he had
possessed some means of making the bear invisible. As
the forecastle was the least visited portion of the ship, he
had chosen to hide himself there behind the anchor-cable.</p>

<p>He trembled whenever anyone approached, and threw
the end of the tarpaulin which covered the deck-freight
over his friend, the bear. The only people whose company
did not incommode him were Fiddle-John and his
children, for whom he testified his devotion by smiles
and gestures and all sorts of endearing Italian diminutives,
which, on account of his caressing tones, even a
dumb brute could not have failed to appreciate. After
a long and exciting pantomime, Truls ascertained that
his name was Annibale Petrucchio and that his bear
gloried in the name of Garibaldi.</p>

<p>Both boys felt that they had made great progress in
each other’s friendship when these facts had been established,
and another hour of dumb show, intersprinkled
with exclamations, resulted in a still more astonishing
revelation, which was that Annibale and his friend slept
every night on deck, because they feared to arouse once
more the purser’s displeasure by invading the steerage.
Sometimes Annibale curled himself up with Garibaldi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
within the coil of the anchor-cable&mdash;he jumped up, dragging
the bear after him, to show the attitude in which
they slept&mdash;but when it rained, or when the sea was high
enough to sprinkle the deck, they both crept under the
deck-freight tarpaulin, where they had made themselves
a little house between two trunks which they had pushed
apart. The only trouble was that the April nights were
very cold&mdash;Annibale shivered all over to show how cold
he was&mdash;and anchor-cables and deck-freight were not
particularly soft to sleep upon.</p>

<p>As Alf and Truls became duly impressed with the
unpleasantness of the Savoyard’s situation, they took
counsel in order to ascertain how they might relieve his
distress. But all the plans that were suggested were
found to be risky, and night came before they arrived at
a decision. The weather had been raw and blustery all
the afternoon, and the officer on the bridge had been
looking every minute uneasily at the falling barometer.
After sunset the gale increased in violence and the ship
pitched and rolled in the heavy sea. In the steerage
there was a terrible commotion; women prayed and
screamed and moaned, children of all ages joined in the
chorus, the lamps swung forward and backward in their
brass frames, and bottles, glasses, and loose crockery
made a terrible racket, sliding to starboard and back
again to port with every motion of the ship. The wind
howled in the rigging, and every now and then a big
wave swept across the deck and poured out through the
scupper-holes.</p>

<p>Alf and Truls, who had been lying awake for hours lis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>tening
to the hollow boom of the waves and the shrieking
of the wind, conversed in a whisper about the poor
Savoyard, who had to be on deck in that terrible
weather, and they finally summoned courage to creep
toward the ladder and slowly to mount it, tightly clutching
each other’s hands. It was a risky undertaking, and
their hearts stuck in their throats as they clung to the
door-knob, hesitating whether they should open the door.
Without knowing, however, they must have given the
knob a twist; for suddenly the door swung open with a
tremendous bang, and Truls was flung across the deck
against the bulwarks with such force that for an instant
he scarcely knew whether he had lighted on his head or
his feet.</p>

<p>He picked himself up, however, without any serious
damage, and as there was a momentary lull in the storm,
he half rolled, half crept up toward the prow, where a
couple of lanterns were swinging in the fore-royal stays.
Nevertheless it was so dark that he could not discern an
object ahead of him, and only groped his way along the
bulwarks, until he stumbled upon a demoralized mass of
rope which he knew to be the anchor-cable.</p>

<p>“Annibale!” he shouted at the top of his voice, “are
you here?” But before he had time to receive a reply
the ship plunged into a monstrous wave, which rose in a
storm of spray and drenched the whole forecastle up to
the mainmast. Truls, in his effort to keep his footing,
tumbled forward and grabbed hold of something wet and
hairy, which slid along with him for a couple of yards,
and then was hauled back by some unseen force. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
boy crawled along in the same direction and shouted
once more, “Annibale! where are you?” And a voice
close to his ear answered:</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ah, Monsieur Truls, Garibaldi et moi, nous sommes à
demi morts.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>“Now, don’t jabber at me, Annibale,” Truls observed,
making his voice heard above the wind; “but if you will
come along with me, Alf and I will give you half of our
berth; and Garibaldi can sleep at our feet.”</p>

<p>Whether Annibale understood the words or not, he
could not fail to comprehend the friendly gestures which
accompanied them. He eagerly seized Truls’ hand and
they plunged bravely forward, but slipped on the wet
deck, and the bear and the boys slid with great speed in
the direction of the descent to the steerage. They were
drenched to the skin and considerably bruised when, after
several unsuccessful efforts, they seized the door-knob.
Alf, as it turned out, feeling too ill to keep watch, had
already preceded them to bed. Garibaldi, who seemed
keenly conscious of his disgrace since the day he molested
the purser, slunk along as meekly as possible, and only
now and then shook his wet skin and coughed in a dispirited
fashion. He was not as grateful, moreover, as
might have been expected, when he was assigned his
place on the straw at the foot of the berth, but gradually
pushed himself upward until his nose nearly touched that
of his master; whereupon he curled himself up comfortably
and went to sleep. It was a very pretty sight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
see the blond Norse boys and the swarthy Savoyard
peacefully reposing on the same pillow, with the shaggy
head of the bear between them, and the Savoyard half
unconsciously clutching his pet in his embrace.</p>

<p>Toward morning the storm began to abate, and the
dim light peeped in through the port-holes. The steerage
was comparatively quiet. Fiddle-John arose and
went on deck; a strange oppression had come over him.
The dim, gray light, the all-enveloping dampness, and
the incessant throbbing and clanking of the machinery
wrought upon his sensitive soul, until he seemed in danger
of going mad. The world seemed so vast and so
empty! The waves heaved and wrestled in their gray
monotony, until it made him dizzy to look at them.
Merely to rid himself of this terrible oppression, Fiddle-John
lifted up his voice and sang wildly against the wind;
his beautiful tenor seemed to cut through the fog like a
bright sword and to flash and ring under the sky. His
soul expanded with his voice; the sun broke forth from
the clouds, and he felt once more free and happy. He
scarcely knew how long he sang; but when by chance he
turned about, he saw to his surprise that a crowd of well-dressed
cabin passengers had gathered about him. His
three children stood holding one another’s hands, looking
in astonishment at the fine ladies shivering in fur-trimmed
cloaks, and wondered why their father was attracting
so much attention.</p>

<p>“Charming!” “Wonderful!” “Magnificent!” exclaimed
the fine people, when Fiddle-John had stopped
singing; and a portly American gentleman, with gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
side-whiskers, who seemed more enthusiastic than the
rest, gave him a slap on his shoulder, and said that if he
himself were ten years younger, he would undertake to
make a fortune out of Fiddle-John, which, of course, was
a very generous offer on his part. Jens Skoug, the emigration
agent, translated the remark; and as the American
seemed to have more to say to Fiddle-John, offered
his services as interpreter.</p>

<p>“What is your trade?” asked the gentleman.</p>

<p>“I sing and play,” said Fiddle-John.</p>

<p>“But I mean, how do you make your living?” repeated
his questioner.</p>

<p>“By singing and playing,” said Fiddle-John.</p>

<p>“You won’t make much of a living by that in America;
people won’t understand you, unless you sing in
English,” remarked the American.</p>

<p>It had actually never before occurred to Fiddle-John
that his songs would be unintelligible in America. He
had supposed that music appealed equally to all nations
and needed no interpreter. The remark of his new
friend, therefore, was a positive shock to him, and it took
him fully a minute to recover from its effect.</p>

<p>“I will sing to the President of America,” he said, in
an injured tone. “Jens Skoug, there, says that the
President will make me a great man when he hears my
voice.”</p>

<p>It did not suit Skoug’s convenience to translate this
remark correctly; and he observed instead, with a confidential
air, that Fiddle-John was a harmless monomaniac
who had got it into his head that he wanted to sing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
President. The American was evidently amused at this,
and said, with a laugh, that he feared the President was
not so great an authority in music as in affairs of state.</p>

<p>Fiddle-John was extremely puzzled and a little distressed
at the jocose manner of the American gentleman;
it could scarcely be possible that he was making fun of
him. But American ways were probably different from
Norwegian ways, and he would therefore not be hasty in
taking offence.</p>

<p>“I know a great many songs,” he said, with a determination
to appear amiable; “and what is more, I can
make songs about anything you choose.”</p>

<p>“Aha, you are a sort of poet&mdash;an <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">improvisatore</i>, as
the Italians say. Now I begin to understand. Perhaps
you can make a song about me,” suggested the American.</p>

<p>“Indeed I can!” cried the Norseman.</p>

<p>“Well, let us have it!” urged the other.</p>

<p>Fiddle-John never needed much urging to sing. He
straightened himself up, flung back his head and was
about to begin, when his son Truls, whose ears had been
burning uncomfortably during the whole interview, seized
his father’s hand and entreated him not to sing.</p>

<p>“Don’t sing to that man, father,” he said. “He is
making sport of you. Please don’t! Both Alf and I
are distressed to think that the gentleman should dare
to speak to you as he does. He thinks&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, sonny! No one is talking to
you,” interrupted Jens Skoug, pushing Truls rudely
aside; but the boy, fired with sudden wrath, wheeled
quickly around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is you who have brought all this misery upon us,”
he cried, excitedly. “I know you mean to desert us as
soon as we get to New York, and I only wish I were big
enough to give you the thrashing you deserve, now, on
the spot.”</p>

<p>“Why, little chickens can crow like big roosters!” Jens
Skoug exclaimed; “but if you don’t keep a civil tongue
in your head,” he added, with a menacing scowl, “I will
make you dance a jig to a very lively tune&mdash;the hazel
tune; perhaps you may have heard of it.”</p>

<p>This was more than Truls could stand; and with
clinched fists, a flushed face, and eyes blazing with anger,
he rushed at the exasperating emigration agent. But the
American, who thought that the fun had now gone far
enough, seized the angry boy by the collar and restrained
him. “Hold on, my little fellow!” he said; “it is
time to stop for refreshments. You are a lively little
customer for your years. I don’t know exactly what you
are mad about, but I can assure you it isn’t worth fighting
for. Now, simmer a little, and then cool down.”</p>

<p>During this scene, Fiddle-John had been standing
irresolutely shifting his weight from one foot to the other
and gazing with a bewildered air at Jens and Truls. He
could not understand what had happened to arouse the
anger of his son, and his excited words had scarcely furnished
him with a clew to the mystery.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;why&mdash;why, don’t you want me to sing,
Truls?” he stammered, helplessly. “I am sure I sing
as well as anybody, and need not be ashamed to be
heard.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it isn’t that, father!” the son responded in a
tone of tender consideration, which appealed strongly to
the American. “You sing beautifully; but these people
would not understand you&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;wait till we
are alone, father; I will tell you what I mean.”</p>

<p>It was the manner, rather than the words, of the boy
which gave the stranger an insight into the relations
which existed between him and his father; and what
he saw, and still more what he inferred, interested him
greatly. There was a diffidence in Truls’ tone, and at
the same time an air of protectorship, which, in one of
his years, was quite touching. The American could not
help admiring his spirited behavior, and he only wished
he could have told him how far he was from wishing to
humiliate either him or his father. But he had lost confidence
in Mr. Skoug as an interpreter, and he saw no
one else who, for the moment, could take that gentleman’s
place. He therefore put his hand caressingly on
the boy’s head and, trusting to his intuition rather than
his knowledge of English, said:</p>

<p>“If you should ever happen to need a friend in the
United States, you must remember to come to me. My
name is Alexander Tenney, and I live in New York.
Here is my card, with my address upon it.”</p>

<p>He gave Fiddle-John and his son each a friendly nod
and sauntered away toward a group of ladies who were
seated in their steamer-chairs, conversing with the captain
about the state of the weather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>It was a beautiful sunny morning in May that the
steamer cast anchor in the bay of New York. Fiddle-John
and his children and a thousand other poorly clad
people from all parts of the world were carried by little
steam-tugs to a large building by the water, where there
was a babel of noise and confusion. Everybody was
shouting at the top of his voice; children were crying,
women hunting for their husbands, husbands hunting for
their baggage; policemen were pushing back the crowd
of screaming hotel-runners who were besieging the doors,
and an official, standing on the top of a barrel, was yelling
instructions to the emigrants in half a dozen different
languages.</p>

<p>Fiddle-John, to whom this spectacle was positively
terrifying, could do nothing but stare about him in a
hopeless and dazed manner, while he pressed his violin-case
tightly in his arms and allowed himself to be pushed
hither and thither by the surging motion of the crowd.
He was finally pushed up to a gate, where an official sat
writing at a desk.</p>

<p>“How old are you?” asked the official, or, rather, the
interpreter, who was standing at his elbow.</p>

<p>“Thirty-five years,” said Fiddle-John; but a vague
alarm took possession of him at the question, and his
heart began to beat uneasily.</p>

<p>“What is your occupation?”</p>

<p>“Occupation? Well, I sing. I am a singer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“A singing-teacher? Is that what you are?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t teach.”</p>

<p>“What do you do, then, for a living? Perhaps you
are a sort of theatrical chap&mdash;a play-actor?”</p>

<p>Fiddle-John looked greatly mystified; he had never
heard of such a thing as a theatre in all his life, and the
word “actor” was not found in his vocabulary. Nevertheless,
he thought it best to keep on good terms with
the great official, and he therefore made one more effort
to explain the nature of his occupation.</p>

<p>“If you will pardon my boldness,” he began, with a
quaking voice, “I may say that I am a kind of poet&mdash;a
minstrel&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Aha, that’s what you are!” roared the official, with
a laugh, as if he had at last found the solution of the
problem; “you are a negro-minstrel, an end-man, clog-dancer,
and lively kind of a chap generally.”</p>

<p>Fiddle-John stood aghast; he was not a combative
character, but the recent scene with the American gentleman
on shipboard had aroused his suspicion, and the
conclusion now suddenly flashed upon him that the official
was making fun of him. The blood mounted to his
head and his whole frame trembled.</p>

<p>“How dare you mock me?” he cried, passionately;
“how dare you call me a negro? Don’t you see with
your own eyes that I am as white as you are?”</p>

<p>“Keep a civil tongue in your head, now, or I’ll have
you arrested on the spot,” the other replied, coolly. “I
can’t afford to waste my time on you. So far as I can
learn, you are a beggar who walks about in the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
singing. Now, that kind of thing won’t go down over
here; and you had better not try it. How much money
have you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any money.”</p>

<p>“And what is your destination? Where do you intend
to go?”</p>

<p>“I am going to see the American President, and sing
to him.”</p>

<p>“Sing to the President! Well, I expected as much.
Why, my good friend, it seems you are a lunatic as well
as a beggar. I shall send you to the Island, and you will
be returned by the next steamer to Norway. It is only
able-bodied, self-supporting emigrants we receive here,
not street-singers and crazy people!”</p>

<p>The poor Norseman stood as if riveted to the spot.
A sudden faintness came over him, and he felt as if he
were going to sink into the ground. He made desperate
attempts to speak, but his words stuck in his throat and
he could not utter a sound. A policeman was summoned
and he was unceremoniously hustled through the crowd
and forced to board a small steam-tug, where, with three
other forlorn and miserable-looking individuals, he was
locked up in a dirty and ill-smelling cabin. All this had
been done so quickly that he scarcely had time to realize
what was happening to him. But now the thought of
his three children came over him with terrible force, and
a sickening sense of his helplessness took possession of
him. In one moment the blood throbbed in his face and
temples, and he burned with heat and indignation; in
the next, the thought of what was to become of his dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
ones, alone and friendless as they were, in a foreign land,
suddenly drove the blood away from his cheeks and he
shivered with dread. He was in the midst of these tormenting
fancies, when the tug gave a couple of shrill
whistles and steamed through the harbor toward an island
covered with gray, dismal-looking stone buildings,
the very sight of which filled Fiddle-John’s breast with
fear.</p>

<p>The children, in the meanwhile, had an experience
hardly less discouraging. They had seen their father
led away by a policeman, and had shouted to him with
all their might; but their voices had been drowned in
the general confusion, and in spite of all their efforts they
had not been able to make their way to him through the
dense throng. They searched for hours, but could find
no trace of him. Being afraid of the man at the desk,
who had been so severe with their father, they hit upon
the plan of slipping through the gate in the train of a
German family which had so many children that it seemed
hopeless to count them. This scheme succeeded admirably,
and toward evening they found themselves in a
broad square planted with trees and budding shrubs.
They still had some hope of finding their father, thinking
that perhaps his detention would merely be temporary;
and they sat upon the benches or roamed along the Battery
esplanade with a miserable feeling of loneliness gnawing
at their hearts. They were hungry, but they did not
know where to turn to obtain bread. The world seemed
so vast and strange and bewildering that it gave one a
headache only to look at it. To ears accustomed only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to the murmur of the pines in the summer night and the
song of birds and the river’s monotonous roar, the huge
city, with its varied noises and its incessant, deafening
rattle of wheels over stone pavements, seemed overwhelming
and terrible.</p>

<p>Only Truls, who had a spirit less sensitive and less
easily daunted than his brother and sister, could summon
courage to think&mdash;to devise a way, if possible, out of
their perplexities. He carefully investigated first his
own pockets, then his brother’s, in the hope of finding
something that might be exchangeable for a loaf of
bread. But he could find nothing except a couple of
buttons, some curious snail-shells, and a folding knife,
the blades of which had been sharpened until there was
scarcely anything left of them. After a few minutes’
meditation, he resolved, although with an aching heart,
to part with his valuable treasures; and he took Karen
by one hand and Alf by the other, and led the way
through the Battery Park toward Greenwich Street,
where he hoped to find a baker’s shop.</p>

<p>They had advanced but a short distance, however, when
they caught sight of their friend Annibale, who was sitting
on a bench, swinging his legs with an air of deep
dejection. His eyes lighted up a little when he recognized
Truls; he jumped up and, pointing to something
resembling a large muff under the bench, exclaimed, in
a tearful voice:</p>

<p>“Garibaldi is very sick. Garibaldi will die. He has
been ill a long time; he will not stand up any more.
He hangs his head like this.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Annibale here demonstrated, with pathetic absurdity,
the pitiful manner in which the little bear hung his head.
There could be no doubt; it was a serious case. Truls
was especially conscious of this, after having stooped
down and noted Garibaldi’s symptoms. His eyes were
much inflamed, his nose was hot, and he frothed slightly
at the corners of his mouth. Yes, it was plain that Garibaldi
was going to die.</p>

<p>Alf and Truls nearly forgot their hunger and their distress
at the thought of this great calamity. By signs
and gestures, they persuaded Annibale to seek lodgings
where his pet might receive proper care and perhaps
stand some chance of recovering. This seemed sound
advice, and Annibale was not slow in following it, when
once he understood it. But it was a very sad march;
for Garibaldi refused to move, and the three boys had to
carry him as best they could.</p>

<p>A lodging-house was finally found where supper and
bed could be procured for twenty cents; and though
neither was particularly inviting, the boys were too hungry
and tired to be fastidious. The Savoyard fortunately
had a little money, which he was very willing to share
with his Norse friends, as soon as he had gained an inkling
of the day’s adventures. Moreover, he had relatives
in the city, and knew the addresses of many Italian
friends. He therefore had no fear of suffering want, and,
as he asserted in his own jargon, could well afford to be
generous.</p>

<p>The boys and the bear slept in a little square box of a
room in which there were two beds, while a kind-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
servant carried weary little Karen to her own apartment.
Truls, out of gratitude to Annibale, offered to watch over
the bear; but, unhappily, his gratitude was not lively
enough to keep him awake, though he struggled bravely
to keep his eyes open. Toward midnight his head sank
slowly down upon Garibaldi’s back, and when the daylight
peeped in through the dusty window-panes he was
yet sleeping peacefully. The sunbeams crept, inch by
inch, across the floor, until they lighted on Truls’ chin,
then climbed up to his nose and reached his eyes. Then
he awoke with a pang, sprang up, and stared confusedly
about him.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes fell upon Garibaldi, who lay immovable
at the foot of the bed; he stooped down and
touched him. The poor bear was stone cold! It had
died quietly in the night. Truls, with a dim notion that
Garibaldi’s death was due to his own lack of watchfulness,
made haste to rouse his friend and explain to him,
with tears of grief and remorse, that he had, without
meaning to do it, used Garibaldi as a pillow, and that
the poor animal had probably died in consequence. Annibale,
however, showed no disposition to reproach Truls,
but, leaping out of bed with a frightened face, flung himself
down over the bear, hugged him, and wept over him,
overwhelming him with caresses and endearing names.
But it was all in vain. Garibaldi was, and remained,
dead. He had caught a violent cold during the night
of the storm at sea, from which he had never recovered.</p>

<p>Although it was yet early in the morning, all the city
seemed to be awake and to be surging and roaring out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>side
of the windows like a storm-beaten sea. Stage-coaches,
carriages, and enormous drays laden with bales
and barrels and boxes, were pouring in steady streams up
and down the street; people of all sorts and conditions
were hurrying hither and thither; and out in the harbor,
but a stone’s throw distant, there was a forest of masts,
and big and little steam-boats rushed shrieking in all directions.
It seemed like tempting Providence to venture
out into this wild turmoil, and Truls implored Annibale
not to risk it, when he perceived that the latter was bent
upon some such dangerous expedition.</p>

<p>Annibale, however, had seen great cities before, and
gave no heed to his companion’s fear, but tore himself
away, promising to return before noon. With a painful
fascination Truls stood watching him from the window,
following his lithe and dexterous motions as he wound
himself through the crowd and dodged the huge wheels
and wagon-poles, as they seemed on the point of knocking
him down. When at last the Savoyard vanished
around a street-corner, and Truls was about to relapse
into his sad meditations, the kind-hearted servant-girl
caused a sensation by entering with Karen and a tray,
upon which were three pieces of bread and three cups of
coffee. Truls then awakened his brother, who had slept
soundly through the recent excitement, and the three
had quite a pleasant meal, considering their forlorn condition.</p>

<p>They covered Garibaldi with a blanket. He had had
a hard life of it on board the steamer, and had suffered
much. Now his career was finished. At least, so Alf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and Truls supposed, until a very extraordinary thing
happened.</p>

<p>They had finished their breakfast some little time,
when the door opened and Annibale entered with a
little, smoky, and shrivelled-up Italian. He was Annibale’s
uncle; his name was Giacomo Bianchi, and by
trade he was a tobacconist. When he talked he used his
arms, legs, eyes, and mouth, all with equal vigor. Fiddle-John’s
children stood and gazed at him in undisguised
wonder; they had never in all their lives seen anything
so lively.</p>

<p>“<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ecco!</i>” he cried, pointing excitedly first to the dead
bear and then to Truls; “the fit is perfect. He is of the
same height, and will do perfectly well. If he has ordinary
intelligence, and not too much of it, he can act the
bear as well as if he were born one. I will prepare the skin
for you, and stuff it just enough to fit his figure. Then
you can make money like the sands of the sea. I have
a small hand-organ at home, and a tambourine which that
vagabond Gregorio left me for a debt. You give me
half of what you earn, and I will lend you all these
things. You will become a rich man before you die.
The bigger boy can play the hand-organ, the little girl
can strike the tambourine, and you yourself lead the bear
and make him dance. Behold, my son, your fortune is
made. <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ecco</i>, I have spoken!”</p>

<p>Giacomo’s dark eyes flashed with enthusiasm as he unfolded
this glorious scheme, and he flourished his stick
so violently in the direction of Karen that she grew
frightened and began to cry. Her brothers, too, viewed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the excitable little man with suspicion, and listened in
no friendly spirit to his unintelligible talk. To their
guileless Norse minds his gestures seemed at first to indicate
insanity, but after awhile they concluded that, for
some reason, he was angry at their sister. Then they
clinched their fists in their pockets and made themselves
ready to pounce upon him, the very moment he ventured
to touch her.</p>

<p>His apparent wrath suddenly left him, however, and
he came up to shake hands with each of them, smiling,
and nodding his shaggy head with extreme affability.
Still they could not quite conquer their distrust of him,
and it required a long and lively pantomime to induce
them to accompany him to his own dwelling. At last
they yielded, because they knew of nothing else to do.
Garibaldi was put into a bag, and Giacomo and the boys,
taking each a corner, carried him easily. First they went
to Castle Garden to inquire for their father, but there
was no one there who knew anything about him. Another
steamer had just come in with over eleven hundred
Polish Jews, and the officials were too busy to give heed
to the questions of the strange-looking boys who talked
a strange-sounding language. All their attempts to get
possession of the baggage were also unavailing; and with
heavy hearts they plodded along together with the Italian
and Garibaldi, winding their way through a labyrinth
of dirty streets, until they reached a little, ill-smelling
bird-shop in Canal Street.</p>

<p>Here, too, there was a bedlam of noise, and the young
Norsemen remained standing in the middle of the floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
staring about them in helpless bewilderment. Two great
blue-and-yellow macaws were shrieking overhead, an ancient
and wise-looking cockatoo was apparently scolding
them for their undignified behavior, and uncounted
paroquets, pigeons, and canary-birds were chirping, cooing,
and screaming in a confused chorus which would have
racked the nerves of a mummy. The barking of a number
of dogs, which seemed to object to the limited area
of their cages, added to the uproar; and it was a great
relief to the whole juvenile company when Giacomo invited
them up-stairs, where he had his own personal
domicile.</p>

<p>The bird-store, according to Annibale’s assertion, was
a source of enormous revenue, but belonged to his other
uncle, Matteo, who was a citizen of much weight and influence
in the Italian colony. This great man, however,
it was understood, had more important matters to attend
to, and left the business in charge of his humbler brother,
Giacomo. A vague impression of these facts Annibale
had managed to communicate to his friends, in spite of
the linguistic difficulties under which he labored; and
the Norse boys, who during the two weeks on the steamship
had learned the Italian names for many common
things and ideas, were pleasantly surprised at the readiness
with which they comprehended the mixture of signs,
gestures, and words which constituted Annibale’s medium
of communication.</p>

<p>Uncle Giacomo’s rooms proved much more agreeable
than the shop below. The noise of the birds penetrated
the floor only as a subdued confusion of sounds, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
not interfere with conversation. On a little low table at
the window there was a multitude of small, sharp tools,
and an array of bottles which emitted strong but not
unpleasant odors. Some of them had feathers sticking
through their stoppers, and others were labelled
“Poison” in big red letters. About the walls there were
rows of shelves, upon which stood bright-colored birds,
perching upon twigs, as if on the point of taking flight,
owls with big yellow eyes and a dignified sullenness of
expression, hawks with wings outspread, swooping down
upon unseen, unsuspicious rabbits; and, besides, there
were little pet dogs and birds, whose skins had been preserved
by the taxidermist’s art for sorrowing owners.</p>

<p>All these objects the boys and Karen found highly
entertaining, and Uncle Giacomo, who was bent upon
making a good impression, allowed them to take down
and examine anything that struck their fancy. The work
of skinning poor Garibaldi also served to occupy their
minds, and thus the forenoon passed rapidly until it was
time to sit down to dinner. They did not sit down, however,
for their dinner consisted only of bread and milk,
and that could be eaten just as well standing. In the
afternoon they were allowed to fetch up some rabbits and
guinea-pigs from the store, and when they had played
with them for a couple of hours, Uncle Giacomo brought
them a green parrot that could talk and scold in both
English and Italian. Neither Alf nor Truls nor Karen
understood its talk; but, for all that, it entertained them,
and served for a time to keep their minds from dwelling
on their misfortunes. They scarcely knew what was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
become of them; the world seemed so vast and so pitiless,
and they themselves such a very small part of it. They
thought with flutterings of hope and fear of their father,
and determined never to abandon their search for him
until they should find him.</p>

<p>Their fate seemed strange and incomprehensible. But
a few weeks ago they were living happily in their quiet
Norse home, in the little cottage under the mountain-wall.
Now they were flung out, helpless and alone, into
a huge whirlpool of foreign life; their mother, whom
they had loved more than anyone else in the whole
world, was dead, and their father was wandering about,
no one knew where, vainly seeking them, perhaps, and
not knowing whither to turn. Indeed, much can happen
in two short weeks. If they had but known what was to
befall them before they left their happy home! Oh, if
they had but known!</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>Nearly a week passed before Garibaldi’s skin was
properly padded and prepared for the reception of its
new occupant; but then it fitted to perfection, and was
as soft and flexible as an overcoat. Truls put it on with
perfect ease, and breathed as freely through Garibaldi’s
nose as if it had been his own. Fortunately the bear had
been of the shaggy, long-haired kind, and when the opening
was laced together with fine silk cords the joining
was completely hidden by the fur. The children had
repeated rehearsals in Uncle Giacomo’s room; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
all agreed that Truls made a very respectable bear. He
could walk on his hind-legs beautifully, he could salute
with his right fore-paw, and he could even nod with his
head in a very intelligent fashion. In fact, there was a
danger that he might be too intelligent.</p>

<p>“Now, do remember,” Alf would cry out to him, “a
bear cannot blow his nose. He may be allowed to
sneeze, and even to cough; but he must not be too frisky
and intelligent. And remember, that if you laugh or
make any sound whatever, the game is up and we are
ruined. Uncle Giacomo only keeps us to make money
with us, but he is not unkind, and as long as we don’t
starve, we ought to be thankful. It all depends upon
you, whether we shall have a home or be thrown into the
streets.”</p>

<p>It was with a great flutter of excitement that the Savoyard
and his Norse friends started out early one Monday
morning in the middle of May. Alf was carrying
the hand-organ, Karen the tambourine, and Annibale was
leading the make-believe bear by the same iron chain
which had regulated the movements of Garibaldi. They
were about to open their first performance on the sidewalk
at the corner of Broadway and Canal Street, but
two policemen were immediately on hand and sternly
commanded them to “trot.” Trot they accordingly did;
but the sidewalks were everywhere so crowded that they
seemed in danger of being knocked down, in case they
should offer to obstruct the hurrying stream of humanity.</p>

<p>It was not until they reached the broad steps of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Sub-Treasury in Wall Street that they summoned courage
to make a second stop; and Truls was by that time
so tired of the unnatural four-footed gait that he rose,
without invitation, and began to promenade in a very unbearlike
fashion. Presently Alf’s hand-organ began to
wail a very sad air from “Il Trovatore,” and Karen struck
the tambourine with a vigor which threatened to ruin
both her knuckles and the drum-skin. A number of
newsboys and bootblacks instantly scampered up to witness
this attractive entertainment, and half a dozen
brokers and bank-messengers also paused to view the
antics of the little bear. Annibale shouted and swung
his whip, and the animal saluted and danced slowly and
clumsily (as he had been commanded), and at the end
of five minutes quite a shower of pennies dropped into
the Savoyard’s hat. The crowd increased; the newsboys
screamed with delight, and scrambled up the steps,
pell-mell, whenever the bear approached them. Truls
began to enjoy the fun, and chuckled to himself at the
thought that he could chase a whole flock of big boys
who, if they had known what sort of a creature he was,
would in all likelihood have chased him. This reflection
made him every moment bolder, and he would have
been in danger of overstepping his part altogether if Alf
had not screamed to him in Norwegian:</p>

<p>“Now, take care, smarticat, don’t be too intelligent!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, just as he was resolving to heed this advice,
a little ragged bootblack, while trying to back away
from him, fell, turned a dexterous somersault, and came
down on his feet on the sidewalk at the foot of the stairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
The sight was so comical that Truls lost control of himself
and burst out laughing; but in the same instant his
brother and sister were at his side, and made so terrific a
noise with their respective instruments that his laughter
was completely drowned in the din. Someone, however,
must have noticed his mirth; for there was a
shriek of merriment among the boys, and one of them
cried out:</p>

<p>“Did you hear that? The bear is a-laughin’! He is
a jolly old coon, that bear is.”</p>

<p>“No, he was only a-yawnin’!” shouted another boy.
“He is a queer old party, and he knows lots of
tricks.”</p>

<p>“Them b’ars is a mighty funny lot,” the first boy rejoined.
“<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: ‘I onct seed’">I once seed</ins> one at the circus; he could ride
bare-back and drink beer.”</p>

<p>“<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber’s Note&mdash;Original text: ‘I onct knowed’">I once knowed</ins> one as could smoke cigars and kiss
his boss,” shouted number two, determined not to be
outdone.</p>

<p>All these comments escaped the bear’s brother, but
Annibale caught a suspicion that something was wrong.
He hastily gathered in the second shower of pennies,
and made a sign to his friends to stop the entertainment.
They made their way as quickly as they could down to
the water-front, and thence to the Battery Park, where
there was plenty of room for another exhibition. The
newsboys and bootblacks followed them for a couple of
blocks, but seeing that they had no intention of stopping,
gradually dropped behind and returned to their accustomed
haunts. Alf and Truls heaved a sigh of relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
when the last of their importunate followers had disappeared;
and it was with a lighter heart that they took
their station under the trees of the park and commenced
the same programme which had been so successful in
Wall Street.</p>

<p>Their audience was here even larger than it had been
at their first performance, but it was not nearly so profitable;
for the foreign emigrants and corner-loafers who
abound in this locality had probably no money to spare,
or they preferred to have their entertainment gratis.
Hardly half a dozen pennies dropped into Annibale’s
hat, in spite of his repeated invitations to contribute. It
was obvious that they had hit upon a bad locality, where
art was not properly appreciated.</p>

<p>As Karen’s knuckles were by this time quite numb, it
was agreed that Annibale should take his turn at the
hand-organ and give Alf a chance to distinguish himself
at the tambourine. They had just completed this arrangement,
and were strolling rather aimlessly past Castle
Garden toward the Coney Island Pier, when they saw a
dense crowd gathered at the entrance of the great immigration
depot. Curiosity prompted them to discover the
cause of the demonstration, and as everyone fell aside to
make room for the bear, they had no difficulty in reaching
the open space in the centre of the throng.</p>

<p>What was their horror when they suddenly found
themselves confronted with a real bear&mdash;a huge black
beast which was dancing slowly upon his hind-legs, and
every now and then, with an angry yawn, showing an
array of terrible teeth! They wished themselves well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
out of sight again, and strove with all their might to
avoid attracting attention. But instead of that, they
found themselves pushed right into the middle of the
ring. And the moment the huge bear spied a comrade,
down he dropped on all-fours and insisted upon making his
acquaintance. With a wild scream which was anything
but bearlike, Truls rose up and rushed toward his brother
Alf, flinging his paws about his neck. The keeper of the
big bear gave him a cut with his whip, but he still strained
at his chain and gave forth angry growls. The people
fled in all directions, and Alf grabbed his disguised
brother in his arms and ran as fast as he could carry
him. The others followed; but before they had overtaken
him he was stopped by a policeman, who inquired
whether he had a license. The boy stared in abject
terror at the officer of the law.</p>

<p>“Pl-please, sir,” he stammered, imploringly, in his
native tongue, “don’t hurt my brother! He isn’t a bear
at all, if you please, sir; and&mdash;and&mdash;I am a harmless lad
who&mdash;who&mdash;arrived from Norway the other day, and&mdash;and&mdash;never
did mortal thing any harm as long as I lived,
sir!”</p>

<p>“Don’t jabber yer Dutch at me, ye young scalawag!”
the policeman replied, seizing the boy by the arm and
shaking him. “Ef it is an honest loivelihood ye’re
afther, why don’t ye drap that poor dumb cr’atur’ and
foind some dacent imployment, begorra?”</p>

<p>Alf was altogether too frightened to make any answer
to this suggestion, of which, moreover, he understood
not a word. He only gazed with his large blue eyes at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the policeman, and moved his lips nervously, without
being able to utter a sound.</p>

<p>“Pl&mdash;please, sir,” he faltered, after several vain attempts
to speak, “please let me go.” And Truls, completely
forgetting his disguise, raised two hairy paws imploringly
toward the officer and begged tearfully.</p>

<p>“Please, sir, do let my brother go!”</p>

<p>The policeman’s face underwent a sudden and startling
change. His eyes nearly popped out of his head, his jaw
dropped down on his chest, and the veins on his forehead
swelled. “I’ll be blowed,” he cried in breathless
amazement, “ef the dumb cratur’ ain’t a-talkin’ Dutch!”</p>

<p>He stooped for a minute, with his hands resting upon
his knees, and stared with a perplexed expression at the
supposed bear; then the situation began to dawn upon
him, and he burst out into a tremendous laugh.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is a foine bear ye be, sonny!” he exclaimed,
lifting the boy-bear unceremoniously on his arm, and
grabbing hold of Alf’s collar with his disengaged hand.
“A smart young un ye be, be jabers! It is an alderman
ye will be before ye doi&mdash;if ye only vote the roight
ticket. ’Tis a shame, it is, ye don’t talk a Christian language,
sech as a gintleman can understand.”</p>

<p>He was moving up Greenwich Street, talking in this
humorous strain, half to himself and half to his prisoners,
whom he was dragging reluctantly along, when his
progress was suddenly arrested by a little girl who became
unaccountably entangled in his legs.</p>

<p>“Mr. Policeman,” the child cried, in the same unintelligible
tongue, gazing up with a pale and excited face at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the tall officer, “please don’t hurt my brothers. And
won’t you please take me along, too? I have been bad,
too, Mr. Policeman&mdash;much badder than Truls.”</p>

<p>“Why, how-de-do, sis!” the officer asked, with a
broad grin. “Is it the bear ye be, did ye say, as lent yer
skin to this little chap? Ah, be jabers! now I begin to
take in yer capers. It is a moighty mixed-up lot ye be,
and up to no end of thricks. But jest ye wait till his
honor gits hold on ye, and he will know how to git each
one of ye back into his roight skin.”</p>

<p>This sinister allusion was lost, however, on the three
culprits, and even if they had understood it, it would
probably not have impressed them greatly. Their life
had been so exciting since they left their quiet Norse
valley, that they had almost ceased to be surprised at
anything that might happen to them. Alf and Karen
plodded on wearily at the policeman’s side, holding on
to the tails of his coat, and showing no desire to part
company with him; and Truls, who was wellnigh exhausted
by the labors and excitement of the day, was
only too glad to be able to rest his shaggy head on the
officer’s shoulders, and to embrace his neck with his two
hairy paws. The officer, somehow, seemed to enjoy the
situation; for he laughed and chuckled incessantly to
himself, as if he were contemplating some delightful plan
which promised a great deal of amusement. He shook
his club good-naturedly at the crowd which followed him,
and pushed his way onward, until he reached a large
brick building, over the door of which was carved, in big
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>Roman letters, “Police Precinct, No. &mdash;&mdash;.” Here he
entered with his prisoners, and after having made an
entry in a book, consigned them to a large, bare, and
dreary-looking room, where a few miserable people were
reposing in various attitudes upon the floor.</p>

<p>The two Norse boys, who vaguely understood that this
was some kind of a prison, looked with horror upon the
ragged and untidy occupants of the room, and withdrew
with their sister into the remotest corner they could find,
so as to escape observation. Here they held a consultation,
glancing all the while fearfully about them, and
lowering their voices to a whisper.</p>

<p>“Truls,” said Alf, raising his guileless eyes to those of
his younger but braver-hearted brother, “what do you
think will become of us? do you think we shall have to
stay long in this dreadful place?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you sillibub!” replied the ursine Truls, with
well-feigned cheerfulness; “we will be let out before
night; and anyhow, I know what I am going to do.
You remember that handsome American gentleman on
board the steamboat, whom I wanted to fight because I
thought he was making fun of father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I remember,” said Alf.</p>

<p>“Well, he gave me his card, which I gave you to keep
in your pocket-book; and he made me promise that if
ever I needed a friend, I should send for him. There is
an address on the card, and I shouldn’t wonder if he is a
great man; and then everybody will be sure to know
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Truls!” his brother exclaimed, admiringly;
“you are always so bright and so clever; and I have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
card here; and I’ll not lose it. But don’t you think you
had better take off your bear-skin, so that the judge may
see you aren’t a bear, but a little boy?”</p>

<p>“I have thought of that,” Truls rejoined, earnestly;
“but the trouble is I haven’t anything else to put on.
So I shall have to go to the judge as I am, and I guess
he won’t be so very mad, when I tell him I haven’t got
nothing else under.”</p>

<p>A dreary hour passed&mdash;dreary beyond expression.
The two boys tried each to persuade the other that he
was, on the whole, not at all afraid, but really quite
cheerful. The only one whose argument was really convincing,
however, was Karen; for she went peacefully to
sleep on Truls’ shoulder, and did not wake until the
policeman came and summoned them all into court.
They made quite a sensation when they entered; and
people rose and craned their necks to catch a glimpse of
the curious group. It was probably the first time that a
bear had marched on its hind-legs into a police-court and
taken its place behind the bar as a prisoner. The judge
smiled a little when he saw it, and leaned himself half
over to the policeman who was apparently giving an account
of the case.</p>

<p>“The officer charges you with roaming about with an
unlicensed bear,” he said severely, fixing a stern glance
upon Alf. “What have you to say to the charge?”</p>

<p>Alf gazed up helplessly, and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you answer?” repeated the judge, impatiently.
“Why didn’t you take out a license for your
bear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The policeman again leaned over and explained that
the prisoners were Dutch, or some other kind of foreigners,
and that they did not understand a word of
English.</p>

<p>“Hm,” growled his Honor, “why didn’t you tell me
that before? Is there anyone in this court-room,” he
went on, raising his voice, “who understands foreign
languages and would be willing to help the court out of
a difficulty?”</p>

<p>He looked expectantly about the large room, but no
one volunteered to act as interpreter of anything so comprehensive
as “foreign languages.”</p>

<p>“The gintleman over there,” the policeman remarked,
pointing out a well-dressed man in the audience, “looks
as if he understood furrin languages.”</p>

<p>The gentleman in question disclaimed all knowledge
of the languages referred to, and the Court visited him
with a look of serious displeasure. It was very annoying,
and there seemed positively no way of disposing of
the case, except to recommit the prisoners until an interpreter
could be found. The judge was about to resort
to that expedient, when a new prisoner was led into
the court, and the boys gave a simultaneous exclamation
of surprise at beholding Jens Skoug, the emigration
agent. Mr. Skoug had evidently come into collision
with a policeman’s club, or some other unyielding substance,
for his left eye was much blackened, and he had
a great bump on his forehead. He had been arrested
the previous night for disturbing the peace.</p>

<p>“That man, it appears, is acquainted with these Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
boys,” the Court remarked, nodding to the policeman
who had charge of Mr. Skoug; “bring him up.”</p>

<p>“Do you understand foreign languages?” the justice
went on, addressing the emigration agent in his severest
judicial tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, lots of them,” replied Jens, drowsily.</p>

<p>“Do you know these boys?”</p>

<p>Jens contemplated the boys with a puzzled frown;
then he shook his head boozily and replied:</p>

<p>“No, yer Honor, I never saw them in all my life.
They are not my style, yer Honor; don’t look as if they
had moved in the best society.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind that,” interrupted the Court; “but
can’t you find out anything about them? why they did
not license their bear? Who provides for them? Where
do they live?”</p>

<p>Jens, in turning his back to the Court, gave Alf and
Karen and the bear a fierce glance, as if to say that he
would make them smart, if they dared in any way to
compromise him. Then, to their surprise, he stooped
down and talked with them earnestly for several minutes.</p>

<p>“Your Honor,” he resumed, rising and facing the
judge; “these boys are, as you supposed, Dutch. They
are utterly destitute, and have no money wherewith to
buy a license for their bear. In other words, they are
vagrants; and if I may be permitted to make a suggestion,
I think the Reform School or the workhouse would
be the right place for them. They are a hardened lot, I
am afraid, judging by their talk&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>“You may spare your suggestions,” the judge interrupted
curtly; “though they happen to fit in exactly
with what I had determined to do with them. Their
bear will have to be killed or sold, and they are hereby
recommitted, and will be sent to the Island for thirty
days.”</p>

<p>Mr. Skoug again stooped down and explained to the
two culprits; but he had no sooner mentioned the word
“kill” than Alf gave a shout, half of anger, half of
dread, pulled his Norse tolle-knife<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> from its sheath,
and with one swift motion slit the bear’s skin from the
neck downward. The policeman rushed forward, the
audience jumped up on the benches, the judge himself
started at the flash of the knife, and was on the point of
leaping over his desk. What was his amazement when,
instead of a bear, he saw a little shivering boy in very
scanty attire! A roar of laughter and a deafening salvo
of applause burst forth from all parts of the room, and it
was in vain that the judge hammered with all his might
on his desk, and in thunderous tones demanded order.
The Irish policeman, to whose taste for practical jokes
the whole scene was due, laughed as if he were going to
split his sides. He would not have ventured to confess
that he had planned some such dramatic incident, although,
as he admitted to himself, it had turned out
even more startling than he had dared to hope.</p>

<p>When order was finally restored, the Court commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
that the prisoners be removed; but Truls, who now comprehended
the situation, and was determined not to
submit to further imposition, marched boldly up to the
judge, and put Mr. Tenney’s card before him on the
desk.</p>

<p>“This gentleman,” he said, confidently, “made me
promise to send for him if I should ever need a friend.
Now I need him, and if you would kindly send someone
to fetch him, I should be much obliged.”</p>

<p>The judge understood the purport of this speech, even
though the words were unintelligible to him. Mr. Tenney’s
name was well known to him, as that of a citizen
of great wealth and influence, and his prisoners immediately
rose in his estimation when he heard that they enjoyed
the protection of so prominent a man. He therefore
beckoned to a policeman, wrote a hasty note, and told
him to have it instantly despatched. The boys and their
sister, in the meanwhile, were permitted to sit down in the
court-room, awaiting Mr. Tenney’s arrival. Mr. Skoug,
who betrayed a great anxiety to be off, pleading a variety
of business engagements, was then examined and fined
ten dollars. He had just managed to disappear through
a side-room when Mr. Tenney’s tall and portly figure
was seen entering. He gave the boys a friendly nod, as
he walked rapidly up to the judge, with whom he conversed
amicably for several minutes. There was something
brisk, energetic, and business-like in all his movements.
He laughed very heartily when the recent
incident with the bear was related to him, and the judge
joined in the laugh, and asserted that it was the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
amusing thing that ever had occurred in all his long experience
on the bench. Then Mr. Tenney apologized for
having taken up so much of the Court’s valuable time,
and the Court expressed itself delighted to have made
Mr. Tenney’s acquaintance and to have been in any way
able to serve him; whereupon Mr. Tenney had the three
children conveyed to his carriage, and they drove away
through the glorious May sunshine, up one street and
down another, until they reached a large and stately
house on Madison Avenue. Here they stepped out of
the carriage, and a liveried servant flung the doors open
before them, as they entered the house.</p>

<p>Such magnificence the boys had never beheld before:
long, wonderful mirrors which looked like strips of lake
standing on end, carpets which felt soft under the feet
like fine moss, and gilt and carved furniture, which
seemed to have stepped right out of a fairy story. It
was certainly very extraordinary; but still more extraordinary
was the kindness and consideration with which
they were treated by Mr. Tenney and his wife. Two
pretty rooms were assigned to them on the fourth floor
of the house; little Karen was dressed in beautiful
clothes, and the boys themselves got each a new suit,
the like of which they had never had on their backs before.
They felt like young princes, and if they could
only have talked with the kind people who took so much
trouble on their account, they would have expressed to
them their gratitude, and perhaps, too, solicited their
aid in ascertaining the whereabouts of their lost father.</p>

<p>Mr. Tenney, however, guessed their thoughts, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
not need to be told that their minds were torn with
anxiety. He first procured a Norwegian interpreter from
one of the steamship companies, and made the boys describe
to him accurately the time and circumstances of
Fiddle-John’s disappearance. He wrote letters to the
emigration commissioners, inserted advertisements in the
newspapers, and set the whole official machinery in
motion to get a clew by which to unravel the mystery.</p>

<p>Investigations were set on foot, detectives were employed,
the Castle Garden officials were questioned and
cross-examined, but there was no one who had the
slightest recollection of having seen Fiddle-John. Thus
three days passed. Mr. Tenney’s determination to accomplish
his purpose increased, the greater the obstacles
were that he encountered. There was a streak of obstinacy
in his temperament, and there seemed to be an
impression abroad that Mr. Tenney was not to be trifled
with, when once he was aroused, and that may have been
the reason why Fiddle-John grew in the course of a week
to be a kind of public character, and people asked each
other jocosely when they met in street cars or in hotel
vestibules:</p>

<p>“How do you do? Seen Fiddle-John?”</p>

<p>Someone, it appears, had seen Fiddle-John, and that
was the purser of the steamboat Ruckert, whose encounter
with the lamented Garibaldi was yet fresh in
the boys’ memories. He came late one evening to Mr.
Tenney’s residence, and explained to him that a man
called Fiddle-John had just been put aboard the ship, as
a lunatic, to be taken back to Norway free of charge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
The ship was to sail the next day at noon; and if Mr.
Tenney would hold himself responsible for the consequences,
the purser said he would undertake to restore
Fiddle-John to his family within&mdash;well, within five
minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. Tenney was quite ready to assume all the responsibility
in the matter, and accordingly the purser raised
the window, and beckoned to a carriage which had
stopped on the other side of the street. The carriage
drove up before the door, and out stepped Fiddle-John.
But oh, how miserable he looked! The light from the
gas-lamp fell upon his pale face, his disordered hair, and
his tall, stooping figure. He was led carefully up the
steps, and the children flew into his arms, hugging him,
kissing him, and weeping over him. He sat down on a
low stool, and stared about him in a bewildered fashion.
But gradually, as his eyes rested upon the dear familiar
faces, his expression softened, the wild look of fright departed
from his face, and the tears began slowly to course
down his cheeks.</p>

<p>“O, children!” he said in a hoarse, broken voice;
“I thought I should never see you again!”</p>

<p>He covered his face with his hands, and wept long and
silently.</p>

<p>“They wanted to make a madman of me,” he sobbed;
“and they almost succeeded. Whatever I did or said&mdash;it
made no difference&mdash;it only proved that I was mad.
I came to believe it, children, and the thought was terrible
to me; if I had staid another day, I should never
have recovered my reason.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Five years have passed since Fiddle-John and his sons
were rescued from misery by Mr. Tenney. They now
live in the porter’s lodge of Mr. Tenney’s beautiful Berkshire
country-seat; and Fiddle-John, with all his eccentricities,
makes a very acceptable porter. The little stone
cottage at the gate of the larger villa looks very picturesque
with the green vines trailing over it, and it is very
comfortably and prettily furnished. Little Karen is now
a matronly little body, with a strict sense of order, and
many housewifely accomplishments. She goes to the
public school in the morning, but studies at home in the
afternoon, and keeps her father company. The boys are
both big fellows now, and they are as good Americans as
any to the manner born. Truls brags of American enterprise,
and the blessings of democratic institutions, as if
every drop of his Norse blood had become naturalized.
He is an engineer, and earns good wages, and is full of
hopefulness for the future. It need scarcely be said that
his sister adores him, and regards him as one of the
most remarkable men of the century.</p>

<p>Alf, who has inherited his father’s handsome face, and
incapacity for practical concerns, is at present preparing
to enter college. Mr. Tenney is much interested in him,
as a lad of unusual ability and a singular sweetness of
character; and it is owing to his generosity that Alf has
been able to follow the career for which he is by nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and inclination adapted. He has his father’s beautiful
voice, too, and makes a sensation in the church choir
every Sunday when he sustains the lovely tenor solo in
the anthems “As Pants the Hart,” and “I Know that
My Redeemer Liveth.”</p>

<p>He is a rather serious fellow, with thoughtful eyes,
and a frank and open countenance. Some think he
would have a fine career as a clergyman, but it is difficult
to tell whether his inclination, in later years, will
turn in that direction. His father, however, does all in
his power to encourage this ambition, and it is not unlikely
that his hopes may some day be fulfilled. In fact,
it is Fiddle-John’s favorite occupation to hope and dream
about the future of his sons.</p>

<p>During the long summer afternoons he sits in the
shadow of the vines, outside of his cottage, while his
daughter reads aloud to him from the old Norse ballad
books which he yet loves so dearly. And it happens
very frequently, then, that the young ladies and gentlemen
who are visiting at the neighboring villas come, in
a company, and beg him to sing to them. They throw
themselves down in easy attitudes upon the soft, close-trimmed
lawn; and their bright garments, their crimson
sunshades, and their fresh, youthful faces make a fine
picture against the green background of elms and chestnut
trees.</p>

<p>To the gentle and guileless minstrel it is a great pleasure
to see these gay and happy creatures; and when the
young girls hang upon his arms and urge him to sing,
his eyes beam with delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Now, do sing, Fiddle-John,” they coaxingly say.
“You know we have walked miles and miles to hear
your voice. And here is a young lady from New York,
who never heard a Norse song in all her life, and
is disappointed, because you look so nice and gentle,
and not wild and savage as a son of the Vikings
should.”</p>

<p>Fiddle-John likes this kind of banter very well; and
when, finally, he yields to their coaxing and lifts up his
clear, strong voice, singing the sad, wild ballads of his
native land, there falls a hush upon the noisy company,
as if they were in the presence of a renowned artist.
These are Fiddle-John’s happiest moments. And it was
just on such an occasion when, on a beautiful afternoon
in July, he had been entertaining the young people with
his songs, that a swarthy-looking Savoyard walked up
before his door, and began to whip up a bear which
danced to a tune from “Il Trovatore,” played upon a
wheezy hand-organ.</p>

<p>“Stop, you sacrilegious brute!” said one of the young
men, addressing, not the bear, but his master; “we have
a better kind of music here than your asthmatic organ
can produce.”</p>

<p>The Savoyard, being apparently well accustomed to
this manner of address, swung his organ across his back
and was about to take his departure, when Karen,
prompted by some idle impulse, stepped up to the bear
and patted it. Then a sudden change came over the
young man’s countenance. He stared for a moment fixedly
at the little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take care, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Carina mia</i>,” he said, with a smile; “that
bear is a real one!”</p>

<p>“Annibale!” she cried in surprise; and, to be sure, it
was Annibale!</p>

<p>He had grown five years older, but in other respects
he had changed but little. He knew but very little
more English than he had done on the day of his arrival,
and his ambition still did not extend beyond hand-organs
and bears. He reaped a plentiful harvest of coins that
night; but that was owing to little Karen, and not to
the doleful hand-organ. She ran into the cottage and
spread out upon the lawn a rug, made out of a small
bear-skin. “Do you know that, Annibale?” she cried.</p>

<p>“Garibaldi, my poor Garibaldi!” exclaimed the
Savoyard, while the tears glittered in his eyes; and he
stooped down and caressed the furry head.</p>

<p>Now the curiosity of the young ladies was excited,
and the whole company clamored for the story of Annibale
and the bear-skin. They all seated themselves in a
ring about Fiddle-John, and he told the story, as I have
told it to you. For I had the good luck to be one of the
listeners.</p>

from five to nine feet long, but only a few inches broad. They are made
of tough pine-wood, and are smoothly polished on the under side, so as to
make them glide the more easily over the surface of the snow. In the middle
there are bands to put the feet into, and the front end of each skee is
pointed and strongly bent upward. This enables the runner to slide easily
over logs, hillocks, and other obstacles, instead of thrusting against them.
The skee only goes in straight lines; still the runner can, even when moving
with great speed, change his course at pleasure by means of a long
pole which he carries for this purpose, and uses as a sort of rudder. Skees
are especially convenient for sliding downhill, but are also, for walking in
deep snow, much superior to the common American snow-shoes.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
